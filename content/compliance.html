<p>Evelyn Learning is a platform for students and educators to share and access course-specific study resources with the intent to help students study efficiently and learn deeply while upholding academic integrity. Evelyn Learning respects intellectual

	property rights of others, so it is important that every Evelyn Learning textbook solution be free from copyright infringement or plagiarism. Consequently, solutions must follow the following guidelines:</p>

<h4>Definition</h4>

<p>According to the <a href="https://copyright.gov/" target="_blank">US Copyright Office</a>, copyright is a form of intellectual property law that protects original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such

	as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, and architecture. Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of operation, although it may protect the way these things are expressed.</p>

<p>Copyright grants the author of a work exclusive rights to copying, distributing, preparing derivative works based on a work and performing or displaying the work publicly. It ensures that authors are the sole benefactors of their work. </p>

<p>Plagiarism is the act of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as your own.</p>

<h4>Guidelines</h4>

<ul>

	<li> While you should have access to the textbook for which you are creating solutions as a reference: <ul>

			<li>Never copy and paste textbook questions into your solutions or onto your workstation.</li>

			<li>Do not rephrase or paraphrase any part of the textbook into your answer.</li>

			<li>Do not include any content in your solutions that is not your original work.</li>

			<li>Do not include the text of the stem or the answer options in your solution</li>

		</ul>

	</li>

	<li> Do not include proper nouns, hypothetical situations, or fictitious data presented in the textbook in any part of the solution. This includes specific names of people, places, or fictitious entities. If references to proper nouns, hypothetical

		situations, or fictitious data is necessary to include in the solution in order to convey the intended meaning, abbreviations or placeholders should be used instead. <ul>

			<li>Example 1: If the question stem includes proper nouns such as "Pauline and Greg are debating the cause of inflation..." the solution can reference "Individual P" for Pauline and "Individual G" for Greg.</li>

			<li>Example 2: If the question stem includes specific places, such as New York and Switzerland, the solution can reference "NY Location" for New York and "Country S" for Switzerland.</li>

			<li>Example 3: If the question includes a fictitious data set, the solution can reference the "first data point" or the "second coordinate pair."</li>

			<li>Example 4: If the question includes a fact such as the function x = 2y, this is considered a fact and can be included in the solution as is.</li>

			<li><i>Exception: When necessary, the names of historical figures may be used in discussing historical deeds or facts (but not hypothetical situations).</i></li>

		</ul>

	</li>

	<li>You should attempt to adopt the methodology presented in a textbook for solving specific types of problems and the specific terminology used in a textbook; however, you should never present text, images, or data from another source as your own.</li>

	<li>You may incorporate factual information such as dates, formulas, and equations in your answers.</li>

	<li>You should never access any existing third-party solutions guides to answer textbook questions. This includes online resources, physical solution manuals, and any solutions in the textbook itself.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Zero Tolerance Policy</h4>

<p>Any author found to have violated these guidelines will be immediately removed from the textbook solutions project.</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<h4>Textbook Solutions Compliance Quality Check</h4>

<br>

<p> The goal of the quality check matrix guideline is used to help QA solution reviewers assess a Compliance related issue with a textbook solution. Use the following criteria's best practices to flag a specific solution for review. </p>

			<td>The solution is in narrative form and incorporates creative elements from the question.  "Creative elements" are those question components where the question author made a creative decision and the element serves a purpose other than being the object of the question.<br><br> For example, in a question using Peter and Paul as characters driving their car to San Francisco, where the question asks about speeds, times, or distances, the solution author should treat Peter, Paul, and San Francisco as creative elements.<br><br>On the other hand, if a question is asking about the apostles Peter and Paul or about the city of San Francisco, these proper names would be the object of the question rather than a creative element.<br><br>A short-hand rule would be: if the author could swap any name or place with any other name or place and the question doesnâ€™t lose any meaning, then the elements are probably creative elements, and the solution author should use symbols or acronyms rather than copying over the names or places.</td>

			<td>The Solution Author has replaced proper names with representative symbols. If the question stem includes proper nouns such as "Pauline and Greg are debating the cause of inflation..." the solution can reference "Individual P" for Pauline and "Individual G" for Greg.<br><br>The solution is a single word, sentence fragment, rule of science, equation, scientific or mathematical theorem or abstract idea, then the Solution Author has not created a new copyrighted work and therefore cannot have created a derivative work.</td>
