<head/><h2>Evelyn Learning Textbook Solutions Citation Guidelines</h2>

<h4>What and When to Cite</h4>
<p>A citation is a reference to a third-party source. The purpose of a citation is to indicate when text contains content from another source.</p>
<p>In general, the use of outside sources should be avoided completely. However, some questions specifically require the use of an outside source, such as a newspaper article or public earnings report. Whenever an outside source is used, the information from the outside source must be cited.</p>

    <p><i class="fas fa-info-circle" style="font-size:48px;color:rgb(161, 24, 127); padding-top: 20px;"></i>These guidelines refer to text only. They do <bold>not</bold> cover the use of art from third-party sources.</p>
</div>


<h4>Quotes</h4>
<p>Unless the object of the question is to respond with a famous quote, do not quote from third-pary sources. In cases where the author must rely on information from a quote, that information should be rewritten in your own words. Quoting third-party sources is "copying" and therefore is a compliance issue, as adding quotation marks and citing the source does not give us permission to use that content.</p>

<h4>Formatting</h4>
<p>A citation consists of two parts: an in-text citation and a list of works cited. <bold>Evelyn Learning uses a hybrid citation format for textbook solutions.</bold></p>

<h5><bold>In-Text Citation</bold></h5>
<p>The in-text citation should appear immediately after the sentence containing the cited informatiion, after the end-of-sentence punctuation but before the next sentence. It should consist of a number inside square brackets, based on the order in which it is introduced. if the same source is used more than once, all in-text citations of that source should use the same number. For example, the first source ited in a given field would appear as [1] in the in-line citation, the second source cited would appear as [2], etc. This number must correspond with the correct item on the list of works cited.</p>

<h5><bold>List of Works Cited</bold></h5>
<p>Since there is no specific field in the templates to list works cited, the list of works cited must be added to the bottom of the field. Information in the works cited list should follow MLA8 format, unless another format is specified for your discipline. To add a works cited list:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>At the end of the field, add an empty line (i.e., carriage return).</li>
        <li>Below that, add a line consisting of three asterisks.</li>
        <li>Below that, add the text "Works Cited" on its own line.</li>
        <li>Below that, list each work cited on its own line. Use the  <a href="">citation generator</a> to format the text properly. In the citation generator, use the MLA8 format unless otherwise specified in the Descipline-Specific Rules.</li>
        <li>Number each work cited to match the in-text citations.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>If a solution has citations in more than one field, the works cited list should appear in the final Explanation field (or in the final step description, for CALC questions).</p>

<h5><bold>Descipline-Specific Rules</bold></h5>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Psychology: use the APA format (instead of MLA) for Works Cited.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>Citation Examples</h4>
<h5><bold>Articles</bold></h5>
<p>Articles from proprietary sources must not be quoted directly. Instead, summarize the key points in your own words and cite the source as shown in the example.</p>

<h5><em>Preview Mode</em></h5>

<h5><bold>Data (Proprietary Source)</bold></h5>
<p>Do <bold>NOT</bold> use information from proprietary (i.e., non-public) sources, as this may be a compliance issue because we may not have permission to use the proprietary source for commerical purposes. A public source is a source that does not require the creation of a user account or require you to agree to any terms and conditions before accessing the informatiion. If the solution is not authorable without using information form a proprietary source, indicate to the reviewer that the solution is not authorable for compliance reasons.</p>
