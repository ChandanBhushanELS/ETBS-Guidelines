<h2 name="guiding_principles">Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>Solutions should be concise, informative, and not overly technical. Keep in mind that students are looking for clear, to-the-point solutions that help them better understand the concept being addressed by a specific textbook question.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Writing should be succinct and clear. Use bulleted lists, numbered lists, or short paragraphs (no more than 3 to 4 sentences) whenever possible. Avoid large blocks of text and avoid overly complex sentences.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Paragraph breaks can be used to separate content when there is no intro sentence and no specific number or hierarchy. </li>
            <li>Bullets are used when there is an intro sentence and the list is unnumbered.</li>
            <li>Numbered lists are used when the question asks for a specific number of ideas/concepts or hierarchical answer whether or not there is an intro sentence.</li>
            <li>If a list item is a structurally complete sentence, it should be capitalized and punctuated as a complete sentence.</li>
            <li>If any of the items in a list are complete sentences, then all of the items in that same list should be complete sentences.</li>
            <li>Do not make list items flow into each other. (For example, list items should not end with commas, semicolons, or conjunctions such as "and" or "or.")</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Examples should be clear, straightforward, and accessible. Examples should enhance a student's understanding of the solution while avoiding overly technical or bloated language.</li>
    <li>Avoid delving too deeply into teaching a concept in a solution.</li>
    <li>Each solution should be considered a standalone answer and references to other solutions, specific pages or content in a textbook, or other questions cannot be included.</li>
    <li>The use of bolding and italics can be used for emphasis, but should be used sparingly. Never bold an entire sentence for emphasis. Never use all caps or quotation marks for emphasis.</li>
    <li>A spell checking tool or applications should be used before submitting solutions.</li>
</ul>
<div class="line"></div>


<h2 name="tone_audience">Tone and Audience</h2>
<p>Writing should be appropriately leveled for college freshmen and sophomores. Write engagingly, but maintain an academic feel. Students should feel like the solution is authoritative, but not dense.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Do not use 1st or 2nd person.</li>
    <li>Avoid using a casual or conversational tone. Avoid personification and editorializing.</li>
    <li>Avoid the use of unclear references (for example, starting a sentence with "Here" or "This" in reference to a paragraph or sentence above).</li>
    <li>Avoid including rhetorical questions.</li>
</ul>

<div class="line"></div>

<h2 name="general">General Style & Spelling Rules</h2>

<p><b>Style:</b> Defer to Chicago Manual of Style (17th Edition) for most cases, but there are specific cases where Evelyn Learning does not follow CMoS.</p>
<p><b>Spelling:</b> Use <a style="color:#002DE4" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com">Merriam-Webster online.</a></p>
<p><b>Citations:</b> Use <a style="color:#002DE4" href="http://www.citationmachine.net/mla8/cite-a-book">MLA 8</a></p>
<p><b>American vs. British spelling:</b> Americanize British spellings (use mold instead of mould, cozy instead of cosy, etc.) with two exceptions. Stet a British spelling in the title of the work (Odour of Chrysanthemums) and for a major character (Time Traveller).</p>
<p><b>Ampersands (&) and other symbols:</b> Do not use if the word can be spelled out for improved clarity</p>
<p><b>Commas in numbers:</b> Use commas in all numbers of 4 digits or more (excluding dates)</p>
<p><b>"due to":</b> avoid, use because</p>
<p><b>East, West, North, South, Central:</b> initial capped when referring to a specific geographical region; lowercase when referring to general direction, e.g., Eastern Europe, Central Europe; the wind came from the west, she traveled north, he writes western novels</p>
<p><b>dialogue:</b> not dialog</p>
<p><b>ellipses:</b> three dots with no spaces and a space between first and last word and dots: Ellipses are formed â€¦ like this.</p>
<p><b>e-mail:</b> per Merriam-Webster</p>
<p><b>em-dash:</b> shift option hyphen (â€”); do not use two hyphens</p>
<p><b>en-dash:</b> option hyphen; use for date spans 1875â€“1930</p>
<p><b>Internet:</b> initial cap</p>
<p><b>mid:</b> hyphenate, e.g. mid-1980s</p>
<p><b>"more than":</b> preferred use is "over"</p>
<p><b>Numbers:</b> Per Chicago Manual of Style 9.3, spell out only single-digit numbers (zero through nine) and use numerals for all others. For book parts and chapters, globally use Arabic numerals, never spelled-out numbers or Roman numerals, regardless of the authorâ€™s style: Part 1, Chapter 1 (not Part One, Chapter One or Part I, Chapter 1). Exceptions: Roman numerals for parts of plays in Infographics.
<ul>
    <li>Follow the exceptions listed in Chicago Manual of Style Chapter 9, in particular 9.5, 9.6, 9.7, and 9.8.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>of course and obviously:</b> avoid both. (A point might not be obvious to a student.) Delete or phrase as "because."</p>
<p><b>Party:</b> initial cap only when referring to a specific party, such as the Communist or Socialist Party or when capped in the book, e.g., 1984</p>
<p><b>Percent:</b> Use the word "percent" in nontechnical contexts; in scientific and statistical copy, use the symbol %.</p>
<p><b>Poetry:</b> For quoted poetry or lines in iambic pentameter (like much of Shakespeare), include a slash / to show the line break and  leave spaces around the slash per CMoS (e.g., O ... that the Everlasting had not fix'd / His canon 'gainst self-slaughter!)</p>
<p><b>Possessive:</b> (check with Chicago for irregular words and special cases, but below is a brief review)
<ul>
    <li><b>Singular nouns:</b> add an apostrophe and an s, e.g., the horseâ€™s mouth, a bassâ€™s stripes</li>
    <li><b>Plural nouns:</b> those ending in an s, add an apostrophe only, e.g., puppiesâ€™ paws</li>
    <li><b>Proper Nouns:</b> do not include if possible copyright issue (see Copyright page); if not a copyright issue, same as regular nouns, including names ending in s, x, or z, in both singular and plural forms, as well as letters and numbers, e.g., Dickensâ€™s novels</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>premier vs. premiere:</b> use premier to mean "first in importance" (a premier authority on Shakespeare) or first in time (a premier voyage). Use premiere to mean a first performance or exhibition (the play had its premiere on February 9, 1952.)</p>
<p><b>Quotation marks:</b> always use straight quotation marks; use for short story titles.</p>
<p><b>Quotes:</b> Avoid putting opening and closing quotation marks and periods in italics or boldface. Examples: when you have the title of a work, and it's italic, if it comes right next to a quotation mark or the end of a sentence, you don't put the punctuation in ital. Example: Salinger said, "<i>Catcher in the Rye</i> is super!"
    <br>In the above, you would want to make sure that the first quotation mark was not ital. Similar for closing quotation marks or terminal punctuation in a sentence. e.g., I really loved <i>Catch-22</i>.</p>
<p><b>quotes in isolation:</b> Avoid quotations as stand-alone sentences. Make them a part of running text, e.g. "As Candide observes after his punishment, â€˜quote.â€™"</p>
<p><b>"recent":</b> Avoid "in recent decades," "in recent times," etc., and other "volatile" wordings. This can't totally be eliminated, but try to avoid when you can. For example, instead of referring to "recent research," state the year the research was conducted.</p>
<p><b>science fiction:</b> never hyphenated</p>
<p><b>sentence length:</b> Aim to keep the lengths of your sentences under about 25 words. Avoid sentences with multiple clauses, and use semicolons sparingly as they tend to add to sentence length.</p>
<p><b>serial comma:</b> always use</p>
<p><b>short introductory clauses:</b> Avoid using commas when meaning is clear; never after "In 1981". See <a style="color:#002DE4" href="http://www.dailywritingtips.com/comma-after-introductory-phrases/">here</a></p>
<p><b>so-called:</b> hyphenate</p>
<p><b>Socialist:</b> initial cap for a party member or party name, lowercase for general use</p>
<p><b>spacing after punctuation:</b> one space only</p>
<p><b>symbols:</b> lowercase in running text (the symbol of the crushed rose)</p>
<p><b>themes:</b> lowercase in running text (the theme  of deception and cruelty)</p>
<p><b>they:</b> use as singular and plural pronoun</p>
<p><b>Titles:</b> Put book titles in italics. Put short story titles in quotation marks.</p>
<p><b>United States:</b> spell out as a noun; U.S. as an adjective; never U.S.A. or USA; United States's as a possessive NOT United States'</p>
<p><b>versus. vs.:</b> spell out versus; use vs. in images</p>
<p><b>World War I/World War II:</b> Only use WWI and WWII in graphics; spell out in text</p>

<h2 name="gender">Gender Guidelines</h2>

<h3>Overall (all subjects except Psychology)</h3>
<p>The language in textbook questions is often filled with references to "males" and "females" in such a way that erases trans, intersex, and other individuals who do not fit into that binary. Even if the textbook isn't particularly inclusive with its wording, Evelyn Learning's solutions can attempt to be.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Whenever possible, remove references to gender in these solutions. Example: In the sentence "A vaginal infection is a major health concern for adult females that can result in pelvic inflammatory disease," the phrase "for adult females" can be removed without affecting student comprehension.</li>
    <li>When removing gendered language is not possible, please use the qualifier "cisgender" or "assigned" (e.g., "cisgender women" or "assigned female"). If there is no viable option to reword, leave it as is and flag the copy supervisor in a JIRA comment listing the question code and indicating that a revision is necessary for inclusiveness.</li>
    <li>Use "they" (not "he/she") as a singular pronoun to refer to an individual whose gender is not specified.</li>
    <li>Please refer to the subject-specific guidelines for exceptions. Additional subject-specific guidelines will be added as they are developed.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Subject-Specific</h3>
<h4>Biology and Anatomy/Physiology</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Avoid phrasing that assigns gender to organs, cells, processes, characteristics, etc. Refer to those organs/cells/processes/characteristics/etc. directly (e.g., "sperm," not "male gamete").</li>
    <li>If it is absolutely necessary to differentiate between different forms of the reproductive system (for example, if the answer is comparing two different forms of the reproductive system as a whole), use organ-specific terms such as "ovarian reproductive system" and "testicular reproductive system," not "female reproductive system" or "male reproductive system."</li>
</ul>

<h4>Psychology</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Since Psychology textbooks spend a significant amount of time specifically discussing and deconstructing gender stereotypes, these guidelines cannot be applied to Psychology solutions without altering the meaning of the solution. </li>
    <li>Specific guidelines for discussing gender in Psychology are under development and will be released in a future update. Please consult the Psychology content lead with any questions.</li>
</ul>

<div class="line"></div>

<h4 name="stem_rules">STEM Terms & Spellings</h4>
<p><b>bacteria:</b> Remember that "bacterium" is singular and "bacteria" is plural. When discussing cells, use "bacterial cell" (for singular) and "bacterial cells" (for plural).</p>
<p><b>cis and trans:</b> cis and trans should be in italic when part of a chemical name or when specifying "<i>cis</i> configuration" or "<i>trans</i> configuration"</p>
<p><b>Crossing-over:</b> Donâ€™t use cross over, use crossing-over in Biology</p>
<p><b>disorders:</b> Use <a style="color:#002DE4" href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm">DSM-5</a> names for disorders over Merriam-Webster. e.g., "attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder"</p>
<p><b>fight-or-flight response:</b> use hyphens</p>
<p><b>Haploid/Diploid:</b> italicize "n":  1<i>n</i>  and 2<i>n</i>.</p>
<p><b>loiasis:</b> not "loaiasis"</p>
<p><b>T cell, B cell, etc.:</b> Follow Merriam-Webster. No hyphen.</p><br>

<h4>Mathematical theorems, laws, properties, etc. - Capitalization</h4>
<p>Use lowercase, but uppercase proper nouns or descriptors based on proper nouns. See CMOS 8.1 and 8.79. Examples below:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>In running text:</b><br>
        Pythagorean theorem<br>
        addition property of equality</li>

    <li><b>In titles/headers, H1, H2, etc. (use headline style):</b><br>
        Derivations of the Pythagorean Theorem<br>
        Using the Addition Property of Equality</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4 name="ss_rules">Social Sciences Terms & Spellings</h4>
<p><b>Slave vs. enslaved:</b> We prefer "enslaved," though there may be instances in which referring to "slaves" as a group is contextually OK for flow.</p>
<p><b>Continental Army/Navy:</b> Please capitalize as these are the formal names of the militaries established by the Continental Congress. Do not lowercase "army" or "navy" here even though Chicago specifically lists as an example "Continental navy".</p>
<p><b>Ten Percent Plan:</b> Keep open (no hyphen) for both the noun and adjectival form per CMOS. Use an en-dash only for ranges, e.g. 30â€“40 percent. </p><br>

<h4 name="ba_rules">Business and Accounting Terms & Spellings</h4>
<p><b>breakeven/break-even/break even:</b> Use "breakeven" (no space) if concept used as a noun; "break-even" (hyphenated) if concept used as an adjective; "break even" (with space) if used as a verb.</p>
<p><b>cents:</b> Instead of writing out the word "cents," use a dollar sign and decimals.  For example, write "$0.49" instead of "49 cents."</p>
<p><b>company names:</b> Refer to the companies as "Company A" or "Company D" instead of including proper nouns</p>
<p><b>less/minus:</b> Replace "less" with "minus."  Example: "Shareholdersâ€™ equity is the value left to owners after debts and obligations have been accounted for, or the businessâ€™s total assets minus its total liabilities."  (not "less its total liabilities")</p>
<p><b>T account:</b> no hyphen should be used
<p><b>work in process:</b> on first use, this term should appear as "work in process (WIP)"; do not use hyphens or quotation marks for this term; subsequent usages after the first usage can be abbreviated to WIP or spelled out as work in process</p>
<p><b>Business Law:</b> The following styles are used in frequently in Business Law</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Usage of italics:</b><br>
    Italicize Latin legal phrases (e.g., <i>prima facie</i> case, negligence <i>per se</i>, <i>certiorari</i>, <i>stare decisis</i>, <i>voir dire</i>).<br>
    Italicize case names (e.g., <i>Green Mountain Chrysler Plymouth Dodge Jeep v. Crombie</i></li>
<br>
  <li><b>Usage of quotes:</b><br>
    Use quotation marks for quotes from case law as cited in the question stem, where choice of words matter in statute or prior rulings (e.g., "material", "utilize banks that can ensure full bank integrity of The Transaction whose undertaking[s] are in complete harmony with international banking rules and protocol and who [sic] guarantee maximum security of a Funderâ€™s Capital Placement Amount"). When quoting from case law, include a citation for each quote. Structure citations as outlined in the Citations guidelines, using the BlueBook Citation System specific to Business Law.<br>
    <br>
      Use quotation marks for legal terms or phrases (e.g., "piercing the corporate veil")</li>
<br>

  <li><b>Usage of abbreviations:</b><br>
    Most Latin phrases are written out and rarely abbreviated. One exception is motions for judgment n.o.v. which will be kept as is and the full form will not be used.<br>
    Abbreviate significant agencies or acts after initial use and definition (e.g., Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)).<br>
    Reporters for case citations are abbreviated according to Blue Book guidelines. </li>
<br>

    <li><b>Usage of special characters:</b><br>
      Include dollar signs for significant dollar amounts (e.g., <span>&#36;</span>75,000 is a meaningful amount for federal litigation law, as it allows you to file in federal court: "Suppose that Shaffer had invoiced Johnson for only <span>&#36;</span>1,500").<br>
      Include numbers for case citations as needed (e.g., PCS Nitrogen Inc. v. Ashley II of Charleston LLC, 714 F.3d 161 (4th Cir. 2013)).<br>
      Use applicable parentheses or hyphens for rules or statutes (e.g., SEC Rule 10b-5, Section 10(b)).<br>
      Use hyphens for industry-standard terms as per the Merriam Webster Dictionary (e.g., e-discovery for electronic discovery). Specific terms that differ from the Merriam Webster dictionary will be added to the Authoring Guidelines as needed. (e.g. Cease-and-desist order, Class-action suits).

<h2 name="use_color">Use of Color</h2>
<p>Color can be applied to text and in drawings/graphs to emphasize points or provide clarity. Color should be used judiciously and only to enhance the learning value.             </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>In this example, the step-by-step explanation in a CALC question uses color to help the student see how electrons being added to each equation help to balance the charges.</p>
