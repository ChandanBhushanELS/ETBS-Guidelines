</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>A</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>A: A SWOT analysis takes place in the planning phase of management, as it is a form of research to help the company set goals.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Incorrect Explanation(s)</h5>

<ul>
    <li>B: The organizing phase of management consists of action steps toward the achievement of goals, whereas a SWOT analysis is a form of research to determine the action steps to take.</li>
    <li>C: Leading pertains to the development and encouragement of others toward the achievement of their own professional goals as well as those of the organization. While leading is perpetually occurring throughout all phases of management, this is not the phase in which a SWOT analysis is typically conducted.</li>
    <li>D: Controlling consists of monitoring, benchmarking, and making improvements to processes and procedures based on actual outcomes compared to previously set goals. A SWOT analysis does not occur in this stage. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>
    Hint 1: A SWOT analysis focuses on understanding an organization’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.<br>
    Hint 2: A company wanting to restructure would need to begin with a thorough SWOT analysis.

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer(s)</h5>
<p>B</p>
<p>D</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>B: Suppliers affect the competitive environment by raising prices or limiting the availability of products and services. They are one of Porter’s five forces. </li>
    <li>D: Threats of substitute goods and services are one of Porter’s five forces. The competitiveness of an organization can be compromised if rivals offer a similar product or service at a lower price. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Incorrect Explanation(s)</h5>

<ul>
    <li>A: Consumers are not threats as defined by Porter’s five forces. Instead, they provide opportunities to increase an organization’s market share. </li>
    <li>C: Competitors do not have bargaining power with a competing organization, as they are not part of the same value chain. They are not one of Porter’s five forces.</li>

<p>true</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>The typical role of a manager is to focus on the core of running the customer-facing side of the business.

				<tr style="text-align:center"><td>2</td><td>Medium</td></tr>
		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Explanation</h5>

    <p>There are four major functions of a manager’s role: planning, organizing, controlling, and leading. At the onset of a managerial role, the functions of planning, organizing, leading, and controlling may happen in sequence. However, any of the functions may be revisited at any time as necessary.</p>

    <p>Planning starts with defining the organization’s mission, vision, and values. Then, it involves determining both short- and long-term objectives and developing strategies to achieve the organization’s mission and vision. This function of management is important because it provides a blueprint to follow so everyone in the organization is on the same page and can work cohesively toward the same goal.</p>

    <p>Organizing is the function that focuses on assigning tasks to achieve the objectives and goals of the organization. This includes the assignment of the best people to accomplish these goals. Organizing is important because it focuses on the creation of an action plan for the goals and objectives developed in the planning phase.</p>

    <p>Leading involves motivating and influencing employees to work hard and keeping them engaged. The management function of leading is one that should be occurring at every point in time. It includes encouraging employees to fulfill their own professional goals as well as helping others to see their purpose in the organization as a whole.</p>

    <p>Controlling involves monitoring processes closely, benchmarking against standards, and taking corrective actions when necessary. It is a means of creating accountability toward achieving goals in a timely manner and assures that activities are being executed as planned.</p>

		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>The correct order is: 5, 1, 4, 3, 2</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>In order to attain any level of achievement, an individual must first have their basic human needs met, e.g., food and water. Such needs comprise the first level of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.</li>
    <li>Once an individual’s basic physiological needs are met, the second level of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs focuses on the need for shelter, also known as safety.</li>
    <li>Once basic human needs and safety are both met in an individual’s life, they can focus on the third level of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs: belonging or love.</li>
    <li>Once basic human needs, safety, and belonging are all met in an individual’s life, they can focus on the fourth level of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs: esteem.</li>
    <li>Finally, once basic human needs, safety, belonging, and esteem are met in an individual’s life, they can focus on the fifth level of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs: self-actualization.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Hint</h5>

<p>Maslow’s hierarchy of needs are achieved from the bottom to the top of the pyramid.</p>

    <li>Fixed assets: buildings, equipment</li>
    <li>Liabilities: accounts payable, interest payable</li>
</ul>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>Current assets are those that can be converted to cash within one year. Inventory and accounts receivable are both assets that can be converted to cash quickly. </li>
    <li>Fixed assets have a longer useful life and usually take more than one year to convert to cash. Buildings and equipment generally last longer than one year and are not sold as quickly as current assets. </li>
    <li>Liabilities are forms of debt and represent money owed. Accounts payable and interest payable are both liability accounts.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>Hint 1: The quicker an asset can be sold for cash, the more current of an asset it is.</p>

				<tr style="text-align:center"><th>DOK</th><th>Difficulty</th></tr>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><td>1</td><td>Easy</td></tr>
		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>An individual with a Green Belt level of training in Six Sigma will help to train others 
    in the process part-time while performing normal duties the rest of the time. An individual 
    with a Black Belt level of training will take on the full-time lead of the project.
</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>
        There are multiple levels of Six Sigma certification. The Black Belt is a 
        mastery level of training, and individuals trained at this level will take 
        the project lead. Those trained at the Green Belt level will be able to start 
        taking on smaller training roles within the project while being mentored by someone with more training. 
    </li>
</ul>

<h5>Hint</h5>

<p>As an individual attains higher Six Sigma training levels, the responsibilities become more focused on the project at 
    large rather than individual tasks at the operational level.

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<p>The Gantt chart of the project reveals several important items of interest:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        There is a small window of time to photograph and gather samples of the products, and there appears to be a week and a half between the photograph end date and the marketing materials end date.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Suggestion: request a small extension on the photograph activity to February 1.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        Preparing the food samples must occur at the end of the project and is highly time sensitive.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Suggestion: move the end date of assembling the goodie bags up to February 20. </li>
        <li>Suggestion: move the start date of preparing the food samples to February 22 and assign preparation tasks.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
