<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>B</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>B:
Using only readily available information is known as availability bias, in which people focus only on the prominent information they already have and avoid searching for more details and options. Since this information might be incomplete, inaccurate or obsolete, it can lead to errors in decision making.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Incorrect Explanation(s)</h5>

<ul>
    <li>A: Extensive search for information collects more total information to be considered. This enriches decision making. </li>
    <li>C: Searching for expert opinion includes other peopleâ€™s views on the matter and can generate options the decision maker wouldnâ€™t otherwise consider. This enriches decision making. </li>
    <li>D: Assessment of alternatives is a common strategy for rational and enriched decision making. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>
    Hint 1: Errors in decision making come from different biases.<br>
    Hint 2: To avoid errors in decision making, more information is better.

</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer(s)</h5>
<p>A</p>
<p>B</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>A: Cognitive dissonance is a conflict between values and attitudes on one side and behavior on the other. In this case, the manager values honesty but is forced to lie; this is a conflict between their values and actions, which is a cognitive dissonance. </li>
    <li>B: In this case, an employee who puts high value on work-life balance chooses to take a promotion that will prioritize work over personal life. This is an example of a conflict between values and behavior, which is what cognitive dissonance stands for.  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Incorrect Explanation(s)</h5>

<ul>
    <li>C: In this case, the sales manager puts high value on environmental awareness. Although they are not able to get the electric vehicle, they did get the hybrid, which is still better for the environment than the conventional gas model they would have gotten otherwise. Therefore, there is some compatibility between value and behavior, and no cognitive dissonance is triggered. </li>
    <li>D: In this case, there is no information about the values of the engineer, so it is unclear if there is cognitive dissonance. The fact that the engineer has worked on individual tasks doesnâ€™t speak about whether or not they value teamwork.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Hint</h5>

<p>Hint 1: To assess cognitive dissonance, information is needed about both values/attitudes and behavior.<br>
	 Hint 2: To find cognitive dissonance, compare the value/attitude with the behavior.

        <i>State the three ways a person or organization can create dependence. Explain how they work and provide one example for each.</i>
	</p>
</div>

<div class="question_metadata">
		<table>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><th>DOK</th><th>Difficulty</th></tr>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><td>2</td><td>Medium</td></tr>
		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Sample Response</h5>

<p>There are three ways a person or an organization can create dependence: </p>
<ul>
<li>Achieve importance. For example, an individual will have importance if they are the key knowledge holder of a critical information; an organization creates importance through products or services that are of key value to stakeholders. </li>
<li>Possess a scarce resource. For example, an engineer who created the main code for a software company has scarce knowledge about the composition of the code architecture. A company creates scarcity when it offers a product or service that is very difficult to find.</li>
<li>Create non-substitutability. For example, a person can create such dependence by patenting an invention, while an organization creates it by introducing an invention to the market. </li>
</ul>


<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>
<p>To create dependence, the resource the firm has should be characterized as important, scarce, or non substitutable, orâ€”best of allâ€”should have all three characteristics. </p>
	<ul>
	<li>The first way to create dependence is through importance. When a firm offers a resource/product fulfilling an important need, people will come searching for it. For example, consider Company T entering the automobile market and  offering a fully electric vehicle which provided an important green substitute for the fossil-fuel-driven cars that were saturating the market.  </li>
	<li>The second way to create dependence is by controlling a resource that is scarce. When the supply of such a resource is not abundant, there is a competition over who can get it, which makes people dependent on the owner of that resource. Continuing with the earlier example, Company T created a product that was scarce because there were few competitors in the electric vehicle market, and none offered the advanced featuresâ€”such as extended rangeâ€”of the Company T cars.</li>
	<li>The third way to create dependency is through a product that is not substitutable or doesnâ€™t have competitors. In such cases, the resource owner makes others dependent on them because there is not an alternative to the ownerâ€™s resources. In the above case, Company T used the non substitutability principle by adding features to its cars that were not available in any other electric vehicle, such as long milage, luxury, and a self-driving feature. </li>

		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>The correct order is: 4, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The first step in decision making is to identify the problem at hand.</li>
    <li>Next, the decision-maker needs to identify all the criteria that are relevant to the problem and will affect the rationality of the decision made, e.g. price, resources needed, efficiency, etc.</li>
    <li>Once a list of criteria is generated, the next logical step is to assign weights to each criterion. For example, the decision-maker should decide on two criteria: e.g., price and efficiency. Is low price as important as efficiency? If yes, assign those criteria equal weightsâ€”50% each; if price is three times more important than efficiency, assign 75% weight to price and 25% weight to efficiency.</li>
    <li>After the decision-making criteria are settled, the decision maker needs to develop alternative solutions to the problem.</li>
    <li>The next step is to evaluate each of the alternative solutions based on the criteria decided upon under steps 2 and 3.</li>
		<li>Finally, the decision maker needs to choose the best alternative according to the evaluations in step 5.</li>

</ul>

<h5>Hint</h5>

<p> Hint 1: The rational decision-making model is built on consequent logical steps, such that each preceding step should be completed before the next one is attempted.<br>
		Hint 2: The order of the steps should make logical sense.

<h5>Answer</h5>
<ul>
    <li>d</li>
    <li>c</li>
    <li>a</li>
    <li>e</li>
		<li>b</li>
</ul>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>d: When competing in a conflict, the goal of each party is to pursue their own needs or goals because those goals are of the utmost importance to the parties. This could come at a high price, such as hurting the relationship with the opposing party or building a negative image. </li>
    <li>c: When collaborating, the parties in a conflict are working together with the goal of achieving a solution that is at least somewhat satisfying to all involved. </li>
    <li>a: Avoiding is a strategy of staying away from a conflict because it is of little concernâ€”or without any expected benefitsâ€”to the uninvolved party. </li>
    <li>e: Accommodating is a strategy for putting the needs of the opposing party above their own needs when it is beneficial to do so, e.g., to maintain a good relationship with the opposing party or to satisfy the opposing party now for a potential future payoff. </li>
		<li>b: The parties in a conflict engage in compromising when the only way to end the conflict is for each of them to give up something.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

    <p>Hint 1: Competing is also called a win-lose strategy.</p>
    <p>Hint 2: Collaboration is also known as a win-win strategy.</p>
    <p>Hint 3: Avoiding is described as a lose-lose strategy. </p>
    <p>Hint 4: Accomodation is also referred to as a lose-win strategy.</p>

<h5>Answer</h5>
<ul>
    <li>expert power: 1) 4)</li>
    <li>referent power: 2) 6)</li>
    <li>legitimate power: 3) 5)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>People have expert power when they have specific knowledge and skills that others donâ€™t have. Both the engineer and the employee relations specialist specialize in highly specific areas, giving them expert power in their respective fields. </li>
    <li>People gain referent power when they are likable and other people are attracted to what they have to say. Both the marketing specialist with the big following and the administrator who is sought after for advice seem to exercise referent power. </li>
    <li>Legitimate power comes to people because of their formal position in the organizational hierarchy. The leader and the manager have such power because of their titles. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>Hint 1: The more specific, unique, or specialized knowledge one has, the more expert power they have.</p>
<p>Hint 2: The more people are interested in what one has to say, the more referent power they have</p>
<p>Hint 3: The position in the organizational hierarchy determines the level of legitimate power.  </p>
