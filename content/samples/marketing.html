<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer(s)</h5>
<p>A</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>F</p>

<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>
<ul>
	<li>A: A low-cost strategy is one of Porter's generic strategies. It occurs when a brand's product aims for the lowest price in relation to competitors' prices.</li>
    <li>E: A focus strategy is one of Porter's generic strategies. It occurs when a brand has a very specific target market. </li>
    <li>F: A differentiation strategy is one Porter's generic strategies. It occurs when a product aims to be unique&mdash;generally in quality and durability&mdash;over its competitors.</li>

</ul>

<h5>Incorrect Explanation(s)</h5>
<ul>
	<li>B: A marketing strategy is not included in Porter's generic strategies. A marketing strategy is a business's overall strategy to turn potential customers into customers. </li>
	<li>C: An upselling strategy is not included in Porter's generic strategies. An upselling strategy is when a marketer persuades a consumer to spend more, upgrade, or purchase an additional good or service.</li>
	<li>D: A promotional strategy is not included in Porter's generic strategies. A promotional strategy is the overall product communication strategy of a brand. </li>

</ul>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>
    Hint 1: Porter's generic strategies help a brand concentrate on its competitive advantage.<br>
		Hint 2: Porter's generic strategies are not mutually exclusive, meaning a brand can use more than one strategy.<br>

<div class="question_example">
	<p><i>If the price of an elastic product is increased, the total revenue for the product will  ________, whereas if the price of an inelastic product is increased, the total revenue for the product will ________.
	</i></p>
</div>

<div class="question_metadata">
		<table>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><th>DOK</th><th>Difficulty</th></tr>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><td>2</td><td>Medium</td></tr>
		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer(s)</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Decrease</li>
	<li>Increase</li>
</ul>

<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>

<p>A product is considered elastic when the percentage change in quantity demanded exceeds the percentage change in price; thus, an increase in price for an elastic product will generate an even greater decrease in quantity demanded for that good, decreasing revenue.</p>
<br>
<p>A product is considered inelastic when the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price; thus, an increase in price for an inelastic product will generate a smaller decrease in quantity demanded for that good, increasing revenue.</p>


    <h5>Hint(s)</h5>

    <p>
        Hint 1: Consumers are more responsive to elastic goods. Elastic goods are often luxury goods and goods with many substitutes. <br>
        Hint 2: Consumers are less responsive to inelastic goods. Inelastic goods are often necessity goods and goods with few or no substitutes.

<br>
<p><i>Describe the AIDA model and its four components.
</i></p>
</div>

<div class="question_metadata">
		<table>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><th>DOK</th><th>Difficulty</th></tr>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><td>2</td><td>Medium</td></tr>
		</table>
</div>

<h5>Solution</h5>

	<p>
			The awareness, interest, desire, and action (AIDA) model is used in marketing to describe a consumer's buying process.<br>
			The stages of the buying process occur in the order listed:</p>
			<ul>
					<li>Awareness is the stage in which a consumer is aware of a product.</li>
					<li>Interest is the stage in which a consumer thinks about purchasing the product.</li>
					<li>Desire is when a consumer has added a product to their in-store shopping cart or online shopping cart.</li>
					<li>Action is the purchase or transaction.</li>
			</ul>
	


<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>

<p>
    The AIDA model is a step-by-step process used from when a consumer first becomes aware of a brand to the consumer making a purchase. Some consumers go through the AIDA model quickly when making a purchase; others take significant time going through the AIDA model.
</p>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>
    Hint: The AIDA model is often used in advertising or sales promotion.

	<p>
        <i>Describe the four stages of the product life cycle, including sales and profits within each stage.</i>
	</p>
</div>

<div class="question_metadata">
		<table>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><th>DOK</th><th>Difficulty</th></tr>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><td>2</td><td>Medium</td></tr>
		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Sample Response</h5>

    <p>The four stages of the product life cycle are introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. A product life cycle illustrates the four stages on a chart, with sales on the Y axis and time on the X axis.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the introduction stage, the product has been launched to the market for consumers to purchase. Costs associated with research and development are high in the introduction stage, making profits non-existent, while sales slowly increase.</li>
	<li>In the growth stage, sales continue to increase and profits appear. It is the most important stage of the product life cycle, because it is when costs from the introduction stage are recouped. Also, the growth stage is the make-or-break stage, meaning if the product does not see significant growth, it may be pulled from the market.</li>
	<li>The maturity stage is when a product sees the largest profits and the most sales. The maturity stage is when the product is at its highest popularity with consumers and is when a product peaks.</li>
	<li>In the decline (i.e., final) stage, both sales and profits decrease due to a decrease in the consumers' demand for that product.</li>
</ul>
  

	<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>
<p>The product life cycle illustrates a product's complete journey from launch to decline and is often expressed as a diagram. Within the diagram, there are four stages: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. The diagram features sales on the Y axis and time on the X axis. During the first three stages&mdash;introduction through maturity&mdash;sales are increasing. Once sales start to decrease, a product has reached its decline stage. Time is dependent upon consumer demand for the product.

<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>
	<p>The growth-share matrix illustrates the market share and the market growth of a product. A question market product is in a low market share and high market growth position, which is typical of an introductory product. A star product is in a high market growth and high market share stage, which is typical of a growing product. A cash cow is in a high market share and low market growth position, which is typical of a product at maturity. A dog is in both a low market share and low growth position, which is typical of a product that is declining in sales.</p>

	<h4>Solution</h4>
	<h5>Answer</h5>
	<p>The correct order is: E, G, C, D, B, H, A, F</p>

	<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>

	<ul>
	    <li>The first stage is the new product strategy. This involves the realistic goals and strategies of a new product. Often, strengths and weaknesses of the overall business are assessed.</li>
	    <li>The second stage is idea generation. Idea generation involves using both internal sources, such as employees, and external sources, such as customer surveys, to try to find an ideal product. Often, there are many different ideas generated in this stage.</li>
	    <li>The third stage is idea screening. This stage filters the ideas generated from the previous stage and aims to narrow down the products that will likely be the most profitable.</li>
	    <li>The fourth stage is business analysis. In this stage, the business analyzes its current product mix and resource allocation. It takes into consideration things like current product mix, facilities, and capacity given its current resources. It also asks itself how the new product could change the overall business. It may change the overall business by number of employees, property, plant, equipment, or other capital expenses. </li>
	    <li>The fifth stage is development. Development occurs when the design, crafting, and production of the product takes place, prior to test marketing the product.</li>
	    <li>The sixth stage is test marketing. Test marketing occurs when a product is given to select consumers to try. Brands want to see their products as favorable to consumers, so the testing phase shows the overall product appeal to consumers.</li>
			<li>The seventh step is commercialization. Once the brand knows its new product is favorable to consumers, based on the previous stage of test marketing, the new product is produced and launched in the commercialization stage. Commercialization is simply introducing a new product to the market.</li>
			<li>The eighth stage is new product performance. Managers and marketers measure the product performance against its standard goals to see if the product outperformed or underperformed against its standards.</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

	<p>
	    Hint : This is a standard process&mdash;beginning with planning and ending  with measurement&mdash;that businesses use to develop a tangible product.
