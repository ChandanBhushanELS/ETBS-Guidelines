<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>d</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    The <b>answer</b> block should contain only the answer identifier (A, B, C, D, etc.) formatted in the same way as the question (lowercase vs. uppercase).
</div>
<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>d: The transverse diameter (measured from the left lateral edge to the right lateral edge) of the chest is normally larger than the anteroposterior diameter (measured from the anterior surface to the posterior surface) of the chest. The anteroposterior diameter increases in conditions such as emphysema, during which individuals have difficulty expiring air from the lungs. This leads to chronic hyperinflation of the lungs.</li>
</ul>

<!-- <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    The <b>explanation</b> block may reference the answer identifier, but doing so is not necessary.
</div> -->

<h5>Incorrect Explanation(s)</h5>
<ul>
    <li>a: A healthy individualâ€™s skin color on their chest should be uniform and similar to that of the face. Rashes or a change in skin color can occur in relation to allergic reactions, oxygenation issues or circulation issues. Purplish skin around the chest can also be indicative of injury to the lungs or hemorrhage.</li>
    <li>b: Normal respiratory rate is between 12 and 20 breaths per minute. Respiratory distress due to the inability to ventilate can be caused by lung conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pneumonia. Breathing slower than this rate is known as hypoventilation and occurs in instances such as sleep apnea or drug overdose.</li>
    <li>c: The ribs normally slope downward toward the feet at a 45 degree angle in relation to the vertebral column. A more horizontal orientation of the ribs is associated with hyperinflated lungs, otherwise known as barrel chest. This is observed in conditions such as emphysema.</li>
</ul>

<!-- <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    <b>Template Considerations</b>
    <ul>
        <li>The answer section(s) should have a class of "answer", a data-type of "mcq_option", and a data-answer attribute set to the appropriate answer identifier</li>
        <li>Explanation section(s) should have a class of "explanation" and a data-answer attribute set to the appropriate answer identifier</li>
        <li>Incorrect explanation section(s) should have a class of "wrong_explanation" and a data-answer attribute set to the appropriate answer identifier</li>

<p>A</p>
<p>B</p>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    The <b>answer</b> block should contain only an answer identifier (A, B, C, D, etc.). If there are multiple correct answers, use multiple answer blocks.
</div>

<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>
<ul>
    <li>A: Epinephrine is used to treat anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction. During anaphylaxis, blood flow is significantly reduced. Epinephrine acts directly on the heart, increasing the heart rate to reverse anaphylaxis by increasing blood flow.</li>
    <li>B: Epinephrine quickly reverses the effects of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is an allergic reaction in which blood pressure decreases. Epinephrine functions to stimulate vasoconstriction (i.e., narrowing of the blood vessels). This causes blood pressure to increase.</li>
</ul>

<!-- <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    Images that are relevant to all of the option explanations should be placed after the last option explanation. Images that are relevant to a specific option explanation should be placed directly following that explanation.
</div> -->

<h5>Incorrect Explanation(s)</h5>
<ul>
    <li>C: Anaphylaxis is an allergic reaction characterized by difficulty breathing. Epinephrine corrects this by increasing respiratory function. This occurs by increasing the diameter of the airway, allowing more air to enter the lungs.</li>
    <li>D: Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threating allergic reaction. During anaphylaxis, body temperature decreases. Epinephrine corrects it by increasing metabolism, which generates heat, thereby increasing body temperature.</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    <ul>
        <li>If a concept is fully explained in the correct answer portion, do not repeat the same information in the incorrect option explanations. Instead, merely explain why it is wrong. For example, if a definition of a term is already defined in the correct answer portion, there is no need to repeat the same definition in the incorrect option explanations.</li>
        <li>Formatting and language for incorrect answer option explanations can follow the same format and same language, as long as values or information pertaining to each incorrect answer option are different. The same applies for the explanations for the correct answers.</li>

            Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) provides a phosphate group to the molecule 3-phosphoglycerate
            (3-PGA). This forms 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which is then further reduced during the
            Calvin cycle to assist in the formation of glucose.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-answer="C"&gt;
            Dihydronicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) donates a pair of electrons to
            1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This reduces the molecule and causes it to then lose a phosphate
            group. The product of this reaction is glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), a three-carbon
            sugar formed in the Calvin cycle that is a precursor to glucose.

        &lt;section class="explanation" data-answer="D"&gt;
            CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also used in the Calvin cycle to form G3P.  For every three CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
            consumed, there is a net production of one G3P. After six turns of the Calvin Cycle, a single
            molecule of glucose is formed.

            Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is not used during the Calvin cycle to form glucose. CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
            is a compound formed when a carbon atom bonds with hydrogen atoms.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="wrong_explanation" data-answer="E"&gt;
            A potassium ion (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is not used in the Calvin cycle to form glucose. Potassium ions
            are instead commonly used by sodium-potassium pumps in cell membranes to maintain the ideal
            concentration of sodium and potassium in living cells.

<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>True</p>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    The <b>answer</b> to a TF question can only be "true" or "false".
</div>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<p>A sterile field provides a working area for health practitioners that is free of microorganisms. This prevents contamination of surgical tools and medical supplies during their preparation.
</p>
<p>A sterile field can be prepared in a number of ways, including from commercially prepackaged kits. During the commercial packaging process, wrapping material is folded over the pack such that four flaps are positioned on the top, outside of the packaging. These flaps provide a place to grab and pull the package open without ever touching the sterile inside of the packaging. </p>
<p>Upon unfolding the flaps, the inner surface of the packaging becomes upward facing. Given that the inner surface of the packaging has not been exposed to any potential contaminants, it serves as the covering of the sterile field. The outer surface of the package has been exposed to the environment and to touching, so it is not sterile.</p>

            Many prokaryotic organisms found in the Bacteria and Archaea domains use electron transport
            chains to produce energy.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            An electron transport chain (ETC) requires a membrane in order to create an electrochemical
            gradient through a series of redox reactions. Since prokaryotic organisms lack membrane-bound
            organelles such as mitochondria, the cell membrane of the organism is used for the ETC. In
            many prokaryotes, a portion of the cell membrane is invaginated, or infolded, to create a
            pocket in the membrane called a mesosome. The mesosome is the site of the ETC in these
            organisms. Some prokaryotes do not form mesosomes, and the cell membrane is used to create
            an electrochemical gradient between the cytoplasm and the surrounding environment.
            &lt;/p&gt;

<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>


<ul>
<p>General adaptation syndrome (GAS) refers to the three stages of physiological events that follow a physical or psychological stressor. While these events are designed to manage the effect of stressor on the body, a prolonged stress response can be deleterious to health.</p>
<p>The three stages of GAS are:</p>
     <nl>
         <li>The alarm stage refers to the immediate response following a stressor. It is typically characterized by a sympatheticâ€”or fight or flightâ€”response, during which a patient experiences increased heart rate and cortisol release for glucose metabolism.</li>
         <li>The resistance stage occurs after the alarm stage, when the body has adapted to the initial stressor. It is accompanied by restoration of hormone levels and vital signs.</li>
         <li>Homeostasis refers to the maintenance of stable internal conditions needed for proper functioning. The exhaustion stage occurs if homeostasis is not restored during the resistance stage. It occurs if there are insufficient resources (i.e., energy) for restoration, and it makes the body vulnerable to additional damage.</li>

            &lt;p&gt;
            An ionic bond forms when electrons are transferred between atoms. This changes the atoms
            into charged ions. The two oppositely charged ions attract each other and form the ionic bond.
            For example, a chlorine atom (Cl) gains an electron from a sodium atom (Na). Chlorine becomes
            a negatively charged ion, or anion, and sodium becomes a positively charged ion, or cation.
            The oppositely charged ions attract each other, forming the molecule sodium chloride (NaCl).
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;images/sodium-and-chloride-ionic-bond-diagram.svg&quot;&gt;

        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="2"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            A covalent bond forms when atoms share pairs of electrons, which is different from the
            loss of an electron that forms an ionic bond. Covalent bonds can be &lt;i&gt;polar covalent
            bonds&lt;/i&gt;, where an unequal sharing of electrons between atoms occurs, or &lt;i&gt;nonpolar
            covalent bonds&lt;/i&gt;, where two atoms share electrons equally. For example, two oxygen atoms
            share electrons to form oxygen gas, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The covalent bond between atoms in
            oxygen gas is a double bond, and two pairs of electrons are shared.

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Sample Response</h5>

<p>During hemodialysis, blood is circulated through a filtering machine that is external to the body. Blood exits the body through an access (i.e., a fistula); filters through the dialysis machine, which removes waste from the blood; then reenters the body. Hemodialysis is a relatively quick (4-6 hours) method done under nursing care.</p>
<p>During peritoneal dialysis, blood remains inside the body. A catheter is used to introduce a detoxifying fluid (i.e., dialysate) into the patientâ€™s abdominal cavity. The peritoneum serves as the filtering membrane through which waste is removed from the blood. The used dialysate fluid and waste are drained out of the body through the catheter.  Peritoneal dialysis is often done at the individualâ€™s home and is done over a longer period (6-12 hours).</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

 <p>Dialysis is a therapy for individuals with renal disease. Healthy functioning kidneys remove wastes, excess water and solutes, and toxins from the blood. Dialysis performs these functions when the kidneys are not functioning.</p>
 <p>Hemodialysis:
 <ul>
     <li>This process filters blood outside of the body through a dialysis machine containing a filter called a dialyzer.
</li>
     <li>A fistula, graft, or catheter is used to gain access to a blood vessel.
</li>
     <li>Arterial blood is sent from the access to the dialyzer.</li>
     <li>Blood entering the dialyzer passes through a chamber that is filled with detoxifying dialysate fluid. Dialysate fluid is a bathing solution composed of water and electrolytes.</li>
     <li>The chambers are separated by a semipermeable membrane. This allows waste (i.e., urea) to collect in the dialysate while maintaining healthy blood composition.
</li>
     <li>Filtered blood is sent from the dialyzer to the access, where it reenters circulation within the body.</li>
 </ul>
</p>
 <p>Peritoneal dialysis:
   <ul>
       <li>This process filters blood inside the body using the lining of the abdominal cavity, known as the peritoneum.</li>
       <li>A catheter is used to gain access to the abdominal cavity.</li>
       <li>Detoxifying dialysate fluid is introduced into the abdominal cavity through the catheter.
</li>
       <li>The peritoneum is a thin membrane rich with blood vessels. Filling the abdominal cavity with dialysate fluid creates an environment conducive to solute exchange between fluids.</li>
       <li>Wastes and toxins move from the blood vessels of the peritoneum into the dialysate, and healthy blood composition is maintained.</li>
       <li>The used dialysate is drained through the catheter along with the waste it contains.</li>
   </ul>

            A volcanic eruption that completely destroys an ecosystem and an area with no soil may
            cause primary succession. During primary succession, organisms called pioneer species
            colonize an area for the first time.
            &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;

                &lt;li&gt;Then pioneer species, or the first organisms, enter the ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;The pioneer species change the environment in which they live and this leads to

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Sample Response</h5>

<p>A 25-year-old who is pregnant has enhanced nutritional needs that must be met to maintain the needs of both the parent and the developing fetus. </p>
<p>Pregnant individuals must obtain higher levels of energy-yielding nutrients. On average, a pregnant person must consume anywhere between 300 and 500 additional calories a day. This is easily obtained as an additional healthy drink and snack each day.</p>
<p>Throughout pregnancy, it is important to make proper dietary choices. This includes obtaining nutrients from a variety of food groups (fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, and protein). Pregnant individuals should also minimize consumption of processed foods in favor of whole foods and fresh produce. Finally, people who are pregnant should avoid smoking and consuming alcohol, as these activities introduce toxins to the developing fetus.</p>
<p>Pregnant individuals should receive adequate vitamins and minerals as well. These nutrients are most frequently obtained through diet supplementation with prenatal vitamins. These supplements are enriched with folic acid, vitamins D, iron, and calcium, among other minerals and compounds. </p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<p>Pregnant individuals are encouraged to follow a well-balanced diet with increased daily intake of several major food groups and nutrients:
    <ul>
        <li>Water intake should increase from ~2 liters to ~3 liters, an increase which is needed for fetal development.
</li>
        <li>Vegetable intake should increase from ~2 cups to ~3 cups to ensure proper vitamin intake.
</li>
        <li>Protein intake should increase to from ~4â€“5 cups to ~6â€“7 cups to support fetal growth.
</li>
        <li>Grain intake should increase from ~6 cups to ~8 cups for increased energy.
</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Supplements taken by pregnant individuals are enriched with vitamins and minerals needed for proper fetal development. They also ensure that the health of the individual is maintained throughout pregnancy.
    <ul>
        <li>Folic acid is needed for proper development of the fetal spinal cord.</li>
        <li>Calcium is needed for proper development of the bones, muscles, and nervous system.</li>
        <li>Vitamin D helps with absorption of calcium from the diet.</li>
        <li>Iron supplementation ensures adequate oxygen delivery for both the parent and the fetus.
</li>
    </ul>

            DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, contains the information that cells use to create proteins,
            but how is this information stored and how does the cell use it to create functional
            proteins? The basic unit of DNA is the nucleotide. DNA uses four different nucleotides:
            adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Different sequences of nucleotides
            specify for different proteins, and the sequence determines the shape and function of the
            protein. However, there are intermediate steps between DNA and the final protein molecule.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            Nucleotides in DNA are organized into groups of three called codons. Each codon is associated
            with a subunit of a protein called an amino acid. There are 64 different possible codons, but
            there are only 21 amino acids that the cell uses to build proteins. Some amino acids are
            specified by the same codon. Amino acids all share a similar structure, but each different
            amino acid has a special functional group. Cells link amino acids together in a sequence,
            and the functional groups of each amino acid affects how it interacts and bonds with
            neighboring amino acids in the sequence.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            The sequence of nucleotides in DNA determines the sequence of amino acids, and the sequence
            of amino acids determines the shape and function of a protein. If an amino acid is removed or
            replaced, the protein will not have the correct shape, and its function will be changed. In
            many cases, a protein that does not have the right sequence of amino acids will not function
            at all.
            &lt;/p&gt;

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>The correct order is: d, b, e, a, c</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li><p>Patient assessment is the first part of the nursing process. During the assessment, a nurse collects information pertaining to the patientâ€™s condition.</p><p>For example, a 25-year-old female patient enters the emergency room complaining of dizziness, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. As part of the patient assessment, the nurse performs a physical examination and notices increased heart rate and decreased skin turgor.</p></li>
    <li><p>During diagnosis, data from the assessment stage is analyzed. This allows for proper identification of patient strengths, along with health concerns that can be addressed through nursing intervention.</p><p>For example, the 25-year-old female patient with increased heart rate and decreased skin turgor is likely experiencing dehydration. The nurse can therefore make a diagnosis of fluid volume deficiency.
</p></li>
    <li><p>Planning and outcome identification refers to the process where goals are set to address the indicated health problems. In addition, a plan is set to prevent the health concerns from manifesting again.
</p><p>For example, in the 25-year-old patient diagnosed with volume deficiency, establishing fluid and electrolyte balance as the most urgent outcome. The nurse will plan administration of IV therapy, develop a rehydrating nutritional plan, and schedule monitoring of fluid levels.</p></li>
    <li><p>During implementation, the established care plan is executed in order to promote health and wellness. Throughout this process, the nurse should document patient progress and challenges.</p><p>For example, the nurse will administer the 25-year-old patient the appropriate IV, as well as document the amount of food administered and consumed. Further, the nurse will monitor and document urine composition and vital signs according to the established schedule.
</p></li>
    <li><p>Evaluation serves to review the effectiveness of the implementation plan. During evaluation, the nurse measures the achievement of established outcomes and identifies variables that impacted the process.
</p><p>For example, the ability of the 25-year-old to respond to treatment is evaluated according to vital signs and urine composition. The nurse will note the length of time taken to establish normal vital signs and urine composition, as well as the treatments that were most effective.
</p></li>

                Mitosis is the duplication of a eukaryotic cellâ€™s nucleus (a membrane-bound organelle
                that contains genetic material) a type of cellular division that occurs in eukaryotes.
                Somatic (non-reproductive) cells that are growing or repairing can undergo mitosis.
                The process consists of five stages, along with cytokinesis, which splits one cell into
                two cells following duplication of the nucleus by mitosis.

<br>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<p>An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive diagnostic exam used to assess the electrical activity of a patientâ€™s heart. An ECG is conducted by placing several electrodes on the surface of the patientâ€™s skin to record electrical currents through the heart in real time.
</p>
<p>An ECG has three main waveforms:
    <ul>
      <li>The P wave is represented by an initial, slight depolarization from the resting baseline. It occurs upon cation (i.e. Na+ and Ca2+) entry into cardiac muscle cells located within the atria, which corresponds to contraction of the atria of the heart.
</li>
      <li>The QRS segment is represented by a large depolarizing current from the resting baseline. It occurs upon cation (i.e. Na+ and Ca2+) entry into cardiac muscle cells located within the ventricles, which corresponds to electrical activity that is generated when the ventricles contract.
</li>
      <li>The T wave is represented by a depolarization from the resting baseline slightly larger than the P wave. During this process, K+ ions are exiting cardiac muscle cells of the ventricles. Consequently, the cells repolarize. This corresponds to relaxation of the ventricles.</li>
    </ul>

</p>
<p>Analysis of the ECG can identify many heart conditions. For example, atrial fibrillation is an irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of stroke. It is characterized by disordered electrical activity within the atria, which can increase the heart rate. On an ECG, atrial fibrillation is identified through the absence of a P wave and prolonged QRS waves. </p>

<p>CD4 cells are immune cells specifically targeted by HIV. Therefore, as HIV infection intensifies, CD4 count decreases. As a result, the CD4 cell count can be used as a measure of intensity of the HIV infection. An observed increase in CD4 count upon HIV treatment indicates therapeutic benefit. Consequently, Drug A is more effective at reducing the effects of HIV infection than Drug B.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
        <b>Step 1</b>: Assign the axes the appropriate variables. Specifically, assign the X axis as the independent variable (i.e., year), while the Y axis should be assigned the dependent variable (i.e., CD4 count).</div>
</div>
<div class="line"></div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
        <b>Step 2</b>: Set the bounds of the Y axis. The lower limit can be zero, while the upper limit should be slightly above the highest reported CD4 count. In this case, 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> is an appropriate value for the upper limit.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="line"></div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col">
        <b>Step 3</b>: Plot the average CD4 count at each time point for each drug. Then, connect adjacent data points for Drug A as well as for Drug B. This shows that, while each drug causes CD4 count to rise, Drug A produces a stronger effect.

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>

<ul>
    <li>1.e</li>
    <li>2.c</li>
    <li>3.b</li>
    <li>4.d</li>
    <li>5.a</li>
</ul>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
   <li>e: A patient in Fowlerâ€™s position is oriented so that their head and torso are elevated, usually around 30â€“45 degrees. This functions to improve circulation and respiratory function by allowing expansion of the thoracic cavity. The legs are often extended and slightly bent, which improves comfort. Consequently, this is typically the position utilized by patients under bed rest when eating, talking, and eliminating waste.</li>
   <li>c: A patient in the lateral position is lying on their side with their arms in front of them. This is a common position for sleeping, so proper positioning must be ensured when the patient is at bed rest. Proper positioning is often achieved through the use of pillows to ensure alignment. The lateral position is also used for surgical access to the kidneys or hip.</li>
   <li>b: A patient in the prone position is arranged so that they are flat on their chest, with arms usually positioned at the side. This is used in a surgical setting when access is needed to posterior structures (e.g., the urinary tract or spinal cord). This position can also be used to help improve ventilation during respiratory distress. </li>
   <li>d: A patient in Simâ€™s position is arranged in order to more easily administer enemas and perform examinations of the rectum or perineum. This is achieved by positioning the patient so that their upper leg is bent at both the hip and the knee, while the lower leg is extended. This positioning also helps achieve comfort during pregnancy. </li>
   <li>a: A patient in the supine position is arranged so that they are flat on their back, with their legs extended. This is used in a surgical setting when access is needed to the thoracic or abdominopelvic cavities (e.g., during a valve replacement).</li>

            c: A &lt;b&gt;point mutation&lt;/b&gt; is a substitution mutation where only one nucleotide is
            replaced with a different nucleotide.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="2"&gt;
            h: A mutation that results in a change to the overall number of nucleotides in a DNA sequence
            is a &lt;b&gt;deletion&lt;/b&gt; mutation when one or more nucleotides are removed, and is an
            &lt;b&gt;insertion&lt;/b&gt; mutation when one or more nucleotides are added.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="3"&gt;
            g: A &lt;b&gt;missense mutation&lt;/b&gt; occurs when the substituted nucleotide results
            in a codon that specifies for a different amino acid than the unmutated codon. For example,
            the codons AAA and AAC differ by one nucleotide but specify different amino acids, lysine
            and asparagine respectively.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="4"&gt;
            a: A &lt;b&gt;nonsense mutation&lt;/b&gt; occurs when the substituted nucleotide results in a
            stop codon. For example, the codon TAC specifies the amino acid tyrosine, while the codon TAA
            is a stop codon and signals the end of the polypeptide chain.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="5"&gt;
            b: A &lt;b&gt;silent mutation&lt;/b&gt; occurs when the substituted nucleotide results in a
            codon that specifies the same amino acid as the unmutated codon. For example, the codons
            TCT and TCC differ by one nucleotide and both specify the amino acid serine.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="6"&gt;
            f: Deletion and substitution mutations result in a &lt;b&gt;frameshift mutation&lt;/b&gt;
            when the number of nucleotides removed or added is not divisible by three, the number
            of nucleotides in a codon. Since DNA is read in groups of three, the addition of one or
            two nucleotides will shift the &ldquo;reading frame&rdquo;
            of the DNA and most of the codons downstream of the mutation will specify for different
            amino acids.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="7"&gt;
            e: Substitution mutations may result in silent, missense, and nonsense mutations.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="8"&gt;
            d: A mutation that does not change the overall number of nucleotides in a DNA sequence
            and affects one position on the sequence is a &lt;b&gt;substitution&lt;/b&gt; mutation.
            That is, one or more nucleotides in the sequence are replaced with the same number of
            nucleotides at the same position.
        &lt;/section&gt;

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<ul>
  	<li>Oral administration: c, d</li>
    <li>Injection: b, e</li>
    <li>Inhalation: a, f</li>
</ul>

<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Oral administration refers to taking a medication by mouth. This serves as the most convenient route of administration, posing few risks to the patient. These medications, however, are not maximally absorbed from the digestive tract. Further, upon being absorbed, many of these drugs may be partially metabolized in the liver rather than in the intended target, which prevents maximal activity.
    </p>
    <p>Common drugs that are administered orally include lisinopril and tetracyclin. Lisinopril is often administered daily and is used to treat hypertension. Tetracyclin is used as an antibiotic, in which case it can often treat urinary tract infections and certain sexually transmitted diseases.
    </p></li>
  <li><p>Injection refers to the use of a needle to directly introduce a medication into a patient. This can be done by injecting medicine just under the skin (subcutaneous), deep into muscle (intramuscular), or directly into the bloodstream (intravenous). Injection improves the drugâ€™s access to target tissue and prevents the drug from being prematurely metabolized. Despite the benefits, administration by the injection route is less convenient than oral administration, and also poses some risks (i.e. infection).
  </p>
  <p>Common drugs that are administered via injection include doxorubicin and amphotericin B. Doxorubicin is administered intravenously and serves as a chemotherapeutic. Amphotericin B is also administered intravenously and is used as an antifungal.
  </p></li>
  <li>
    <p>Inhalation refers to the introduction of a drug into the airway, typically through use of an inhaler. The inhaler contains aerosol droplets of medication within a pressurized container designed for convenient self-administration. During administration, the droplets coat the surface of the recipientâ€™s airway and lungs, causing the drug to diffuse into the bloodstream. This allows the drug to act rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>Common drugs that are administered via inhalation include fluticasone propionate and beclomethasone. Fluticasone propionate is a steroid medication that is used to treat allergies and other common nasal symptoms (e.g., congestion). Beclomethasone is used for long-term management of asthma as well as treating nasal congestion.
    </p></li>
</ul>

<br>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>Hint: A drugâ€™s route of administration is determined based on its ability to access target tissues.</p>
