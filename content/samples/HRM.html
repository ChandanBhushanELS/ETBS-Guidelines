		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer(s)</h5>
<p>A</p>
<p>B</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>A: The Social Security Act of 1935 established unemployment insurance to help stabilize workers when they are laid off for a short period of time. Employers fund this benefit through the federal and state taxes they pay. </li>
    <li>B: The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 provides that employees are given up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year, as long the company has over 50 employees and the employee requests leave for the birth of a child, the adoption of a child, or to care for themselves or an immediate family member with a serious health condition. </li>
</ul>

<h5>Incorrect Explanation(s)</h5>

<ul>
    <li>C: Disability insurance is a benefit that an employer may offer, but it is not mandated by law. This insurance covers a portion of an employeeâ€™s salary if they cannot work because they become disabled.</li>
    <li>D: Retirement plans are often offered to employees as a benefit, but they are not required by law.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>Hint 1: The U.S. Department of Labor and the Social Security Administration oversee the benefits required by law in the United States.<br>
	 Hint 2: Part-time employees often donâ€™t get the same benefits as full-time employees. Benefits required by federal law would go to all employees regardless of their status as full- or part-time.

        <i>Is the following statement true or false? <br>
					 Voluntary employee turnover is costly to organizations.</i>
	</p>
</div>

<div class="question_metadata">
		<table>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><th>DOK</th><th>Difficulty</th></tr>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><td>1</td><td>Easy</td></tr>
		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>True</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<p>

Voluntary turnover is when an employee leaves an organization by choice. Although it may be less costly than involuntary turnover, an organization must still incur the expenses of recruiting, hiring, and training a replacement to fill the vacant job.

</p>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>When an employee leaves an organization, the job still has to be done.</p>

        <i>Profit sharing is a form of ________________ pay.
</i>
	</p>
</div>

<div class="question_metadata">
		<table>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><th>DOK</th><th>Difficulty</th></tr>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><td>1</td><td>Easy</td></tr>
		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>incentive</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<p>
    Profit sharing is when a percentage of the organizationâ€™s profits are paid out in addition to an employeeâ€™s base salary. Incentive pay is when an employee is paid for resultsâ€”such as a part of the companyâ€™s profitsâ€”rather than being paid for their time.
</p>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>Hint 1:Base salary is the amount of money paid to an employee that was agreed to when they were hired. Base pay may not continuously motivate an employee to work at their highest contribution level. <br>
	Hint 2: Another type of this kind of pay is commissions.

		<table>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><th>DOK</th><th>Difficulty</th></tr>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><td>1</td><td>Easy</td></tr>
		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>An HRIS system contains computerized records of human resources functions. The information gathered is used to support strategic decision making.</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<p>
    As specialized software for human resources, an HRIS manages processes such as recruiting, storing employee data, attendance tracking, benefits administration, and  payroll.
</p>

<h5>Hint</h5>

<p>A human resources professional needs many different kinds of data to do their job.  </p>

			<tr style="text-align:center"><th>DOK</th><th>Difficulty</th></tr>
			<tr style="text-align:center"><td>2</td><td>Medium</td></tr>
	</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>There are many factors to consider when deciding what type of incentives to offer employees. Although employees may have preferences, it is best to offer stock grants to employees rather than cash. Stock grants are not an immediate cash expense to the company, and they align the employeesâ€™ contributions with the performance of the company.
</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<p>
	Both types of incentives have merit:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Cash has an immediate and finite payout amount.</li>
		<li>Stock grants give the employee an ownership interest in the company. It is an incentive to motivate employee contributions for a period of time.</li>


	</ul>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>Some types of incentive pay align employees with the long-term performance of the organization.  </p>

	<p>
        <i>A senior manager observes that a new manager on the team is exhibiting poor conflict management skills and is acting arrogant. Rather than dismissing the new manager, it is determined that employee development should be offered. As an HR representative, you are asked to create an action plan to address the problem.</i>
	</p>
</div>

<div class="question_metadata">
		<table>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><th>DOK</th><th>Difficulty</th></tr>
				<tr style="text-align:center"><td>3</td><td>Medium</td></tr>
		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Sample Response</h5>

    <p>It is difficult to address problem employees. First, gather information from a variety of sources, in addition to the immediate manager. Be tactful but direct in a conversation with the new manager. Seek to find out how the new manager is doing and attempt to find out what is causing the behavior. </p>

    <p>Based on the new managerâ€™s responses, offer the appropriate resources such as training, a referral to an employee assistance plan, counselling, or time off.</p>

    <p>Directly provide objective feedback about the behavior using concrete examples and the effect of the behavior on other people. Give examples of appropriate behavior for the new manager to model. Lastly, explain the consequences if there is no behavior change and provide motivation for positive change. This could be accomplished through weekly meetings to review performance changes and assessment of their efforts toward goal achievement.</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>
<p>In order to address the issue, a private conversation needs to occur with the new manager. To prepare for the meeting, create an action plan for modifying behavior. <br>

The steps used to create a sample action plan are follows:
 </p>
	<ul>
	<li> Gather information to find out what happened by first creating a script of three or four questions to ask the people who are involved. Sample questions include: what happened in the specific instance? Has this happened before? If so, how frequently and how long has the disruptive behavior been happening? Would they like to add anything?

  </li><br>
	<li>  Have a meeting with the new manager. Using the list in step 2, have a discussion where the goals are to: dig deeper to find the root of the problem, offer resources and additional training, discuss consequences
</li><br>
	<li> Provide a written report of what is being specifically required of the new manager to continue employment, and have them acknowledge receipt by signing and dating the report. </li>
	<li>Follow up with the new manager in a specified time, perhaps three months later, to assess their performance. </li>

				<tr style="text-align:center"><td>1</td><td>Easy</td></tr>
		</table>
</div>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>The correct order is: 5, 2, 1, 3, 4</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>An assessment of training needs is the first step where the organization decides what the employees need to learn.</li>
    <li>Next, the organization must determine if the employees have the necessary skills, attitudes, and motivations in order to begin the training.</li>
    <li>Planning for the training includes deciding on the learning objectives for the training, finding the instructors, and deciding on the appropriate training measure.</li>
    <li>After planning, the training is implemented. The training classes take place.</li>
    <li>The results of the training are evaluated. This step provides feedback on how well the training met its stated objectives..</li>
</ul>

<h5>Hint (s)</h5>

<p>Hint 1: The order of the instructional design process is similar to the decision-making process.<br>
	Hint 2: A feedback loop should be designed into the system in order to make it dynamic. <br>
	Hint 3: Before any progress can occur in the design function, the process must begin with a definition of purpose and scope.
