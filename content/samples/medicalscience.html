<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>D</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    The <b>answer</b> block should contain only the answer identifier (A, B, C, D, etc.) formatted in the same way as the question (lowercase vs. uppercase).
</div>
<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>D: The pupillary reflex is the reaction of the pupils to constrict when light is shone into the eyes. If a person has a pupillary reflex at all, even if it is weak, this indicates brain activity, and they do not meet the criteria for brain death.</li>
</ul>

<!-- <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    The <b>explanation</b> block may reference the answer identifier, but doing so is not necessary.
</div> -->

<h5>Incorrect Explanation(s)</h5>
<ul>
    <li>A: Reflexes are involuntary; therefore, in a person with typical brain function, they cannot be overridden. For example, when the plantar reflex is tested by stroking the bare sole of the foot, a person with typical brain function responds with reflexive plantar flexion. A person who meets the criteria for brain death will lack reflexes and their foot will not move.</li>
    <li>B: A person experiencing apnea is one who is not breathing. A person who meets the criteria for brain death is not capable of breathing without assistance.</li>
    <li>C: An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a measure of a personâ€™s brain waves. A flat, or isoelectric, EEG does not change from the flatline position and is seen in brain death, as it indicates that there is no electrical activity in the brain.</li>
    <li>E: The gag reflex is an important protective reflex that causes an individual to gag when an object unintentionally enters the pharynx (throat). Lacking this reflex indicates that the brain is not equipped to protect the body against choking and is therefore among the criteria for diagnosing brain death.</li>

</ul>

<!-- <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    <b>Template Considerations</b>
    <ul>
        <li>The answer section(s) should have a class of "answer", a data-type of "mcq_option", and a data-answer attribute set to the appropriate answer identifier</li>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer(s)</h5>
<p>B</p>
<p>C</p>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    The <b>answer</b> block should contain only an answer identifier (A, B, C, D, etc.). If there are multiple correct answers, use multiple answer blocks.
</div>

<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>
<ul>
    <li>B: Genomic imprinting results when the effect of either a sperm or an egg is silenced (i.e., its effect is never observed in the resulting individual). Various mechanisms can result in genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting affects a personâ€™s genetics because half of the genome is silenced, but it is not a mechanism that alters the personâ€™s epigenetics.</li>
    <li>C: Histones are proteins that allow DNA to condense by wrapping around the histones like a spool. This ensures that the long, strand-like molecule does not get tangled. When histones are modified the histones wind DNA more tightly or loosely and either blocks or facilitates transcription of genes in a way that was not possible prior to the modification. Histone modification typically increases gene expression and can cause conditions in humans such as the development of allergies.

<h5>Incorrect Explanation(s)</h5>
<ul>
  <li>A: Methylation of the DNA is an addition of a methyl group to the DNA. The addition makes it so that transcription factors cannot reach the DNA at that location and cannot transcribe it. As a result, the information coded by the methylated DNA does not get expressed in the resulting protein. This is a common epigenetic alteration that frequently causes disease in humans. Methylation of DNA occurs naturally through the course of aging. In addition, it can be induced by certain behavioral factors, such as smoking.</li>
  <li>D: While the state of hydration (i.e., the amount of water present in the body) can affect a personâ€™s physiology, it does not affect their epigenetics. Complications of dehydration include increased blood viscosity, electrolyte imbalance, and reduced ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen to the tissues (hypoxia).</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    <ul>
        <li>If a concept is fully explained in the correct answer portion, do not repeat the same information in the incorrect option explanations. Instead, merely explain why it is wrong. For example, if a definition of a term is already defined in the correct answer portion, there is no need to repeat the same definition in the incorrect option explanations.</li>
        <li>Formatting and language for incorrect answer option explanations can follow the same format and same language, as long as values or information pertaining to each incorrect answer option are different. The same applies for the explanations for the correct answers.</li>

            Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) provides a phosphate group to the molecule 3-phosphoglycerate
            (3-PGA). This forms 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, which is then further reduced during the
            Calvin cycle to assist in the formation of glucose.

        &lt;section class="explanation" data-answer="C"&gt;
            Dihydronicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) donates a pair of electrons to
            1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This reduces the molecule and causes it to then lose a phosphate
            group. The product of this reaction is glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), a three-carbon
            sugar formed in the Calvin cycle that is a precursor to glucose.

            CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also used in the Calvin cycle to form G3P.  For every three CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

            molecule of glucose is formed.

<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>True</p>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    The <b>answer</b> to a TF question can only be "true" or "false".
</div>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<p>When a person holds their breath, carbon dioxide is not expelled and is retained in their blood. Carbon dioxide has a high affinity for water, forming carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) when they combine. Formation of carbonic acid within blood causes a decrease in pH (i.e., blood becomes acidic).
</p>
<p> At homeostasis, water composes at least 50% of whole blood. Therefore, the longer a person holds their breath, the more carbon dioxide they retain and the more acidic their blood becomes.

            Many prokaryotic organisms found in the Bacteria and Archaea domains use electron transport
            chains to produce energy.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            An electron transport chain (ETC) requires a membrane in order to create an electrochemical
            gradient through a series of redox reactions. Since prokaryotic organisms lack membrane-bound
            organelles such as mitochondria, the cell membrane of the organism is used for the ETC. In
            many prokaryotes, a portion of the cell membrane is invaginated, or infolded, to create a
            pocket in the membrane called a mesosome. The mesosome is the site of the ETC in these
            organisms. Some prokaryotes do not form mesosomes, and the cell membrane is used to create
            an electrochemical gradient between the cytoplasm and the surrounding environment.
            &lt;/p&gt;

    <li>acetaldehyde</li>
</ul>

<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>


<ul>
    <li>
      <p></p>Acetaldehyde is generated when an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase breaks down consumed ethanol (the type of  alcohol found in alcoholic beverages).
      <p></p>In small and infrequent quantities, the body can rid itself of acetaldehyde relatively easily, although it irritates mucous membranes and contributes to the effects associated with a hangover (e.g., headache, nausea). However, frequent consumption of alcohol causes retention of acetaldehyde in the tissues, where it behaves as a carcinogen.

            &lt;p&gt;
            An ionic bond forms when electrons are transferred between atoms. This changes the atoms
            into charged ions. The two oppositely charged ions attract each other and form the ionic bond.
            For example, a chlorine atom (Cl) gains an electron from a sodium atom (Na). Chlorine becomes
            a negatively charged ion, or anion, and sodium becomes a positively charged ion, or cation.
            The oppositely charged ions attract each other, forming the molecule sodium chloride (NaCl).
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;img src=&quot;images/sodium-and-chloride-ionic-bond-diagram.svg&quot;&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            A covalent bond forms when atoms share pairs of electrons, which is different from the
            loss of an electron that forms an ionic bond. Covalent bonds can be &lt;i&gt;polar covalent
            bonds&lt;/i&gt;, where an unequal sharing of electrons between atoms occurs, or &lt;i&gt;nonpolar
            covalent bonds&lt;/i&gt;, where two atoms share electrons equally. For example, two oxygen atoms
            share electrons to form oxygen gas, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The covalent bond between atoms in
            oxygen gas is a double bond, and two pairs of electrons are shared.

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Sample Response</h5>

<p>
    Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune condition. The immune system is prompted to attack the myelin surrounding the nerves of the peripheral nervous system. As a result, signals from sensory and motor neurons are delayed or stopped. If left untreated, severe cases of GBS can result in significant paralysis.
</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

 <p>
    The cause of GBS is still unknown. Many patients with GBS previously experienced some type of infection, though GBS does not occur after every infection. GBS is initially characterized by progressive weakening of the limbs, although the reason is neurological, not muscular. Both the humoral and cell-mediated aspects of the adaptive immune system attack and destroy the myelin sheaths that insulate peripheral nerves.
</p>
<p>GBS is not a permanent condition, and its duration is shortened if a person receives intravenous immunotherapy. Physical therapy typically accompanies medical treatment. However, muscle weakness persists in approximately one of three affected individuals.

            A volcanic eruption that completely destroys an ecosystem and an area with no soil may
            cause primary succession. During primary succession, organisms called pioneer species
            colonize an area for the first time.

            &lt;ul&gt;

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Sample Response</h5>

<p>As the water in an under-hydrated personâ€™s bloodstream is used up by tissues of the body, the plasma becomes hypertonic (i.e., high ion concentration and proportionately low water concentration) in comparison to the hypotonic red blood cells (i.e., low ion concentration and proportionately high water concentration). Therefore, water is drawn out of the hypotonic red blood cells by osmosis until the cell crenates (shrivels). The ability to deliver oxygen is inhibited in crenated red blood cells. This poses a risk of hypoxemia (i.e., low oxygen concentration in the blood), poor oxygenation of tissue, organ failure, and potentially death. Upon rehydration with intravenous fluids, crenation can usually be reversed, restoring function.</p>
<p>At homeostatic conditions, red blood cells contain a low concentration of ions. Pure water, on the other hand, has an ion concentration of 0%. Because osmosis continues until equilibrium (which could not be reached since ion concentration within the red blood cell cannot be diluted to 0%), pure water would continually move into the red blood cells, causing them to swell and rupture (hemolyze), destroying the cells. This will kill the patient.</p>
<p>Saline is used in IV drips because saline is a hypotonic solution. Thus, water molecules move by osmosis into the red blood cells from the saline solution as it is introduced into the bloodstream. However, equilibrium can be reached between ion concentrations of the red blood cell and the saline, allowing both the plasma and the red blood cells to safely be rehydrated without risk of hemolysis.</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<p>A state of dynamic equilibrium called homeostasis exists for many facets of the bodyâ€™s chemistry, including the concentrations of its fluids. At homeostasis, plasma (i.e., the fluid component of blood) typically consists of water (approximately 50%), as well as ions and proteins. An under-hydrated personâ€™s blood lacks the proper amount of water, so the formed elements (i.e., the cellular portion of the blood) become proportionately high and the blood becomes more viscous (i.e., thicker) as a result. This risks seizure due to electrolyte imbalance, organ damage or failure, and death.</p>
<p>All solutions, including blood plasma, are made up of solutes (particles that are dissolved such as ions and glucose) and solvents (i.e., components, usually liquid, that dissolve the solutes). Water is considered a universal solvent because its polar nature causes it to dissolve most solutes. Osmosis, the diffusion of water, is driven by the solute concentration of the surrounding environments. For example, when a solutionâ€™s solute concentration is high, solvent is proportionately low. This is referred to as a hypertonic solution. When the opposite is trueâ€”when a solutionâ€™s solute concentration is low and the solvent concentration is proportionately highâ€”this constitutes a hypotonic solution.</p>
<p>During osmosis, water moves from hypotonic solutions to hypertonic solutions until equilibrium is reached. Thus, when IV fluids are given, they are administered directly into the bloodstream of an under-hydrated patient to increase the water concentration within the blood plasma. Increasing the water within the plasma can rehydrate red blood cells to their normal shape and function via osmosis.</p>

            &lt;p&gt;
            DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, contains the information that cells use to create proteins,
            but how is this information stored and how does the cell use it to create functional
            proteins? The basic unit of DNA is the nucleotide. DNA uses four different nucleotides:
            adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Different sequences of nucleotides
            specify for different proteins, and the sequence determines the shape and function of the
            protein. However, there are intermediate steps between DNA and the final protein molecule.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            Nucleotides in DNA are organized into groups of three called codons. Each codon is associated
            with a subunit of a protein called an amino acid. There are 64 different possible codons, but
            there are only 21 amino acids that the cell uses to build proteins. Some amino acids are
            specified by the same codon. Amino acids all share a similar structure, but each different
            amino acid has a special functional group. Cells link amino acids together in a sequence,
            and the functional groups of each amino acid affects how it interacts and bonds with
            neighboring amino acids in the sequence.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            The sequence of nucleotides in DNA determines the sequence of amino acids, and the sequence
            of amino acids determines the shape and function of a protein. If an amino acid is removed or
            replaced, the protein will not have the correct shape, and its function will be changed. In
            many cases, a protein that does not have the right sequence of amino acids will not function
            at all.
            &lt;/p&gt;

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<p>The correct order is: e, h, a, b, l, j, c, f, m, k, d, i, g</p>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
    <li>e: The right atrium is where the blood receives deoxygenated blood returning from the systemic circuit (which supplies blood to the body) via the vena cavae. Deoxygenated blood from coronary circulation (which supplies the cardiac muscle) is also deposited into the right atrium.</li>
    <li>h: After leaving the right atrium, blood passes through the tricuspid valve. Tricuspid means â€˜three-cusped,â€™ in reference to the three pieces of tissue that compose the valve. The tricuspid valve is sometimes called the right atrioventricular (i.e., separates an atrium from a ventricle) valve.</li>
    <li>a: Blood from the right atrium drains into the right ventricle. The chambers of the heart can fill with blood when the heart is in a brief state of relaxation between pumps, known as diastole.</li>
    <li>b: The right ventricle contracts to send blood through the pulmonic valve. This valve is sometimes referred to as the pulmonary semilunar valve in reference to its half-moon shape. Blood is said to be in the pulmonary circuit after passing through this valve until its return to the heart.</li>
    <li>l: The pulmonary trunk is a large artery that carries deoxygenated blood away from the heart. It splits into a left and right pulmonary artery, which travel to the left and right lung, respectively.</li>
    <li>j: The pulmonary arteries are among the only arteries that carry deoxygenated blood. They receive blood from the pulmonary trunk and carry it to the lungs.</li>
    <li>c: The lungs receive deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary arteries. Oxygen is introduced into the blood via the smallest capillaries within the lungs.</li>
    <li>f: There are two pairs of pulmonary veins: the left and right pulmonary veins, which pick up oxygenated blood from the left and right lungs, respectively, and return it to the heart. The pulmonary veins are among the only veins that carry oxygenated blood.</li>
    <li>m: Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium from the pulmonary circuit, which supplies blood to the lungs. The left atrium contracts to eject blood into the next part of the system. The contracted state of any of the heartâ€™s chambers is called systole.</li>
    <li>k: Blood leaving the left atrium flows through the bicuspid valve. This two-cusped valve is also called the mitral valve or the left atrioventricular valve.</li>
    <li>d: The left ventricle is the thickest chamber of the heart. because its contraction needs to be strong enough to propel blood into the systemic circuit (i.e., all the vessels of the body).</li>
    <li>i: When the contraction of the left ventricle generates enough pressure, the aortic valve (also called the aortic semilunar valve) opens. Blood exits the heart and enters systemic circulation through the aortic valve.</li>
    <li>g: The aorta is the first vessel in systemic circulation. It is a large, elastic artery that is structurally equipped to receive and distribute high-pressure blood ejected from the left ventricle.</li>

                Mitosis is the duplication of a eukaryotic cellâ€™s nucleus (a membrane-bound organelle
                that contains genetic material) a type of cellular division that occurs in eukaryotes.
                Somatic (non-reproductive) cells that are growing or repairing can undergo mitosis.
                The process consists of five stages, along with cytokinesis, which splits one cell into
                two cells following duplication of the nucleus by mitosis.

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>
    Hint 1: Valves separate the chambers of the heart either from each other or from the major vessels.<br>
    Hint 2: The right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood, while the left side of the heart pumps oxygenated blood.<br>
    Hint 3: The heartâ€™s close association with the lungs contributes to many of the structures in the pathway having the word â€˜pulmonaryâ€™ in their name.<br>

</div>
<br>

<h5>Explanation</h5>
<p>There are eight significant volumes and capacities that can be observed from a spirogram. These volumes vary by a personâ€™s height, build, age, and health of their respiratory system.</p>
<p>Total lung capacity is the total amount of air that can be measured in the lung when it is fully inflated.
</p>
 <ul>
    <li>residual volume: This is a small amount of air that always remains in the respiratory passages, keeping the lungs from collapsing. A person cannot exhale their residual volume; it is only removed if the lung is punctured.</li>
    <li>At rest, the volume of air that is moved with each breath is called the tidal volume.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>If a person exceeds a normal tidal inhale by taking a deep breath, the volume of air moved is called the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV).</li>
        <li>If a person exceeds a normal tidal exhale by exhaling forcefully, the volume of air moved is called the expiratory reserve volume (ERV).</li>
              <ul>
                <li>After the ERV is expelled, residual volume represents the air that remains (i.e., the amount of air that keeps the lungs inflated and cannot be expelled under normal conditions).</li>
              </ul>
        </ul>
<p>When a person experiences an asthma attack, the respiratory passages constrict. As a result, breaths grow more shallow and the respiratory rate increases.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shallow breaths represent a decrease in tidal volume.</li>
    <li>Shallower breathing also results in a decrease in both the IRV and ERV because the volumes of inhalations and exhalations are reduced.
</li>
    <li>Because complete exhalations cannot occur during an asthma attack, more air is retained in the lungs, and the residual volume increases.</li>
    <li>The only volume that remains unchanged is the total lung capacity.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h5>Explanation</h5>

<ul>
  <li>D: A carcinoma is a cancer of the epithelia; a cancer of the glands is further distinguished as an adenocarcinoma. An example of a carcinoma is squamous cell carcinoma (i.e., skin cancer). The most common adenocarcinoma is esophageal adenocarcinoma, cancer of the mucous-secreting glands in the esophagus.</li>
  <li>I: Leukemia is the term for cancer of the blood. This commonly refers to cancer within either the myeloid cells (i.e., blood stem cells within the bone marrow) or the white blood cells. Leukemia is the most common type of cancer seen in children.</li>
  <li>J: A benign tumor is one that is not cancerous. An example is a meningioma, a swelling of the meninges that is typically filled with cerebrospinal fluid. This is a serious condition that usually requires removal, although the reason is because it can press on and affect the structures of the brain, not because it is cancerous.</li>
  <li>A: Mesenchymal tissue includes the connective tissue, muscle tissues, and bones. Therefore, skeletal muscle cancer (rhabdomyosarcoma) and bone cancer (osteosarcoma) both fall within the same class: sarcomas.</li>
  <li>H: A malignant tumor is cancerous. The cells of malignant tumors appear abnormal upon inspection and are known to divide more rapidly than normal cells, even those within benign tumors.</li>
  <li>C: Lymphoma is cancer of the lymphatic system. Lymphomas are often subcategorized as being either Hodgkinâ€™s or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The difference is in the type of lymphocyte that is cancerous: if an abnormal version of lymphocyte known as a Reed-Sternberg cell is detected, it is termed Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma. If a sample is devoid of Reed-Sternberg cells, the cancer is deemed non-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma. Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma tends to be diagnosed in earlier stages, so it tends to have a better prognosis.</li>
  <li>G: Leukopenia is a decrease in the number of white blood cells; the consequence is a weakened immune system. It can occur as a side effect of chemotherapy.</li>
  <li>E: Thrombocytopenia (i.e., a decrease in the number of platelets in the bloodstream) can occur secondary to chemotherapy. However, if a patient has not undergone chemotherapy and presents with thrombocytopenia, it can be indicative of myeloma (i.e., cancer of the bone marrow).</li>
  <li>B: An oncovirus is one that, when contracted, can cause a person to have an increased chance of developing cancer later in life. Common oncoviruses include the Epstein-Barr virus (i.e., mononucleosis) and human papillomavirus (i.e., genital warts).</li>
  <li>F: Apoptosis is a mechanism that allows a cell that is infected or otherwise damaged to autolyse (i.e., self-destruct). This is an important mechanism in maintaining homeostasis, and it commonly occurs during viral infections to help prevent the virusâ€™ spread. Additionally, the cell can protect against cancer by autolysing when factors that would lead to inappropriate growth are detected. However, cancerous cells tend to suppress the apoptotic pathways, promoting their immortality.</li>

        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="2"&gt;
            h: A mutation that results in a change to the overall number of nucleotides in a DNA sequence
            is a &lt;b&gt;deletion&lt;/b&gt; mutation when one or more nucleotides are removed, and is an
            &lt;b&gt;insertion&lt;/b&gt; mutation when one or more nucleotides are added.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="3"&gt;
            g: A &lt;b&gt;missense mutation&lt;/b&gt; occurs when the substituted nucleotide results
            in a codon that specifies for a different amino acid than the unmutated codon. For example,
            the codons AAA and AAC differ by one nucleotide but specify different amino acids, lysine
            and asparagine respectively.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="4"&gt;
            a: A &lt;b&gt;nonsense mutation&lt;/b&gt; occurs when the substituted nucleotide results in a
            stop codon. For example, the codon TAC specifies the amino acid tyrosine, while the codon TAA
            is a stop codon and signals the end of the polypeptide chain.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="5"&gt;
            b: A &lt;b&gt;silent mutation&lt;/b&gt; occurs when the substituted nucleotide results in a
            codon that specifies the same amino acid as the unmutated codon. For example, the codons
            TCT and TCC differ by one nucleotide and both specify the amino acid serine.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="6"&gt;
            f: Deletion and substitution mutations result in a &lt;b&gt;frameshift mutation&lt;/b&gt;
            when the number of nucleotides removed or added is not divisible by three, the number
            of nucleotides in a codon. Since DNA is read in groups of three, the addition of one or
            two nucleotides will shift the &ldquo;reading frame&rdquo;
            of the DNA and most of the codons downstream of the mutation will specify for different
            amino acids.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="7"&gt;
            e: Substitution mutations may result in silent, missense, and nonsense mutations.
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section class="explanation" data-type="text" data-answer="8"&gt;
            d: A mutation that does not change the overall number of nucleotides in a DNA sequence
            and affects one position on the sequence is a &lt;b&gt;substitution&lt;/b&gt; mutation.
            That is, one or more nucleotides in the sequence are replaced with the same number of
            nucleotides at the same position.
        &lt;/section&gt;

<h4>Solution</h4>
<h5>Answer</h5>
<ul>
  	<li>I.I.S.: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10</li>
    <li>A.I.S.: 4, 5, 6, 9</li>
</ul>

<h5>Explanation(s)</h5>
<ul>
        <li>I.I.S.: Innate immunity is immunity that a person has at birth; they do not have to gain it through exposure to pathogens. Innate immunity has components that are non-specific, which means that they will destroy a variety of foreign invaders, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites.</li>
        <ul>
           <li>Immune system proteins (lysozyme, complement interleukins, and antimicrobial peptides) circulate in the bloodstream and can mobilize into the tissues when invasion is detected.</li>
           <li>During the process of birth and during breastfeeding, an infant is colonized by the normal flora of their mother. This resident flora inhibits the successful colonization of pathogens.</li>
           <li>One of the only lymphocytes (white blood cells) associated with the innate immunity is the natural killer (NK) cell. NK cells patrol the bloodstream, attacking any abnormal cell encountered, including cancerous cells.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>A..I.S.: The adaptive immune system is built upon exposure to pathogens. This system is continuously built throughout the course of a personâ€™s life, as they encounter new pathogens frequently during regular activities. Adaptive immunity provides high specificity for pathogens, which enables a fast and widespread defense. Adaptive immunity also provides a cooperative approach between its components, which allows it to operate with a low risk of misidentification and destruction of self cells (i.e., cells comprising the personâ€™s body).</li>
        <ul>
            <li>When a pathogen is encountered, phagocytic white blood cells present the antigen (i.e., a molecule that elicits an immune response) to the T cells, which divide into cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells. Cytotoxic T cells destroy encountered pathogens, while helper T cells stimulate B cells.</li>
            <li>When helper T cells present the antigen to B cells, they divide and differentiate into plasma cells, which produce antibodies that will specifically target and destroy the pathogen.</li>
            <li>When invading cells are destroyed and the immune response is no longer necessary, the activity of plasma cells and cytotoxic T cells subsides. However, a small quantity of T and plasma B cells live on in the bloodstream as memory cells. These cells provide immunological memory of the pathogen and allow rapid reactivation of the adaptive immune response if the pathogen is encountered again.</li>
        </ul>

<br>

<h5>Hint(s)</h5>

<p>Hint: The adaptive immune system is built when a person encounters a pathogen, so it is associated with higher specificity than innate immunity.</p>
