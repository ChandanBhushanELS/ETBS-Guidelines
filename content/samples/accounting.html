<ol type="a">
	<li>April, a staff accountant for Rogers & Co., is confused by the process for estimating
		uncollectible-accounts expense using an aging schedule; she struggled with this topic
		when she was in her accounting program in college. When she is given the responsibility for reviewing the entries related to her company’s uncollectible-accounts expense and the aging schedule, she compares this period to the prior period and does not do any further review or analysis as is needed.

	<li>Will is on the audit staff of Monroe & Co, CPAs. He is assigned to the audit of Lafayette Holdings, a fast-growing technology firm that is run by his stepmother. He is excited to be assigned to this exciting audit because he feels it will help to advance his career. He does not disclose the relationship to anyone, nor does his stepmother.</li>
	<li>Shana is the treasurer of Oxford Company. She knows that her company plans to keep
		its investment in Google stock for several years. (It has actually been pledged as collateral for a loan that Oxford has at a local bank.) However, she decides to classify the Google stock as a short-term security. Classifying the Google stock as a short-term. security makes it a current asset and increases Oxford's current ratio, making the com- pany look more favorable to investors.

	<li>Conway Corporation has a large number of customers who buy on credit. Nick, the
		controller for Conway, deliberately underestimates the amount of uncollectible account

		If the company’s income reaches or exceeds the target, monetary performance bonuses
		for all members of management, including Nick, will be awarded.

<h2 name="es">ES Question</h2>
<p><bold>Question:</bold></p>
<h4>CONTINUING CASE</h4>
<p><bold>Consumer Purchasing Strategies and Legal Protection</bold><br>
	It sputtered and squeaked and, with a small hesitation followed by an abbreviated lunge, it was finally over. Ol’ Reliable, the car Jamie Lee had driven since she first earned her driver's license at the age of 17, completed its last mile. Thirteen years and 140,000 miles later, it was time for a new vehicle. <br>
	After skimming the Sunday newspaper and browsing the online advertisements, Jamie Lee was ready to visit car dealers to see what vehicles would interest her. She was unsure if she would purchase a car brand-new or used, and finance with a down payment or lease. “No money down and only $\$219$ a month,” Jamie Lee read, “with approved credit.” Sounded like an offer she would be interested in. Jamie Lee knew she had a good credit rating, as she made sure she paid all of her bills on time each month and kept a close eye on her credit score ever since she was the victim of identity theft several years ago. The more she thought about the
	brand-new car, the more excited she became. That new car fit her personality perfectly! <br>
	As Jamie Lee inquired about the advertised vehicle with the new-car salesperson, her excitement quickly turned to dismay. The automobile advertised was available for $\$219$ a month with no money down, based on approved credit, but Jamie Lee unexpectedly found that there were further qualifications in order to get the advertised price. The salesperson explained that the information in the fine print of the newspaper advertisement stated that the price was based on all of the following criteria: being active in the military, a college graduate within the last three months, a current lessee of the automobile company, and having a top-tier credit score, which he noted was above 800. If Jamie Lee did not meet all of the qualifications, she would not receive the price advertised in the promotion. But, he noted, he could get her in that vehicle-for an additional $110 per month. Two hundred and seventy-five dollars was the maximum Jamie budgeted for a monthly payment. This vehicle was outside of her financial plan. <br>
	Jamie Lee had to start over from scratch. She decided that she must fully research the vehicle purchase process before browsing at another dealership. She felt she was getting caught up in the moment and vowed to do her research before speaking with another salesperson.
	
</p>
<p>Question: <br>
	1. Jamie Lee is considering a used vehicle but cannot decide where to begin her search. Using Personal Financial Planner Sheet 34, Transportation Needs, and the internet for your research, evaluate two possible choices that may be available to Jamie Lee, considering her budget, for a used car purchase.</p>

<h2 name="gr">GR Question</h2>
<p><bold>Question:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Regression; choosing among models.</bold> Apollo Hospital specializes in outpatient surgeries for relatively minor procedures. Apollo is a nonprofit institution and places great emphasis on controlling costs in order to provide services to the community in an efficient manner.</p>
<p>Apollo's CFO, Julie Chen, has been concerned of late about the hospital’s consumption of medical supplies, To better understand the behavior of this cost, Julie consults with Rhett Brat,
	the person responsible for Apollo's cost system. After some discussion, Julie and Rhett conclude that there are two potential cost rivers for the hospital’s medical supplies costs. The first drivers the total number of procedures performed. The second is the number of patient-hours generated by Apollo. Julie and Rhett view the latter as a potentially better cost driver because the hospital does perform a variety of procedures, some more complex than others.
	</p>
<p>Rhett provides the following data relating to the past year to Julie.</p>
