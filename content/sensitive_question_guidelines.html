<h4 name="How_Do_I_Know_if_a_Question_is_Sensitive">How Do I Know if a Question is Sensitive?</h4>
<p>Culture and age affect how topics are perceived, and affect which topics are sensitive. The primary users of Evelyn Learning Textbook Solutions are college students in the United States, and certain topics are considered sensitive for this United States culture. Solution authors should become familiar with the list of sensitive topics so that they may identify sensitive questions while working on solutions. </p>
<p>Sensitive questions may address one or more of the following topics. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mFA-EhYU56ChG5fSi5CtVcZfp0r-rethN8OdRrNgaVo/edit#gid=0">Sensitive Topics</a> document is an expanded list that includes sensitive issues within these topics. </p>

<h4 name="Authoring_Solutions_to_Sensitive_Questions">Authoring Solutions to Sensitive Questions</h4>
<p>Solutions to questions involving sensitive topics should focus on facts and scientific evidence. Content in the solution should be aligned with the discussion of the topic in the textbook and informed by the author's expertise. </p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Solutions should include the objective information that a student needs to find the answer.</li>
<li>Solutions should never take a strong position, stance, or attitude on a sensitive topic</li>
<li>Narrative writing should be avoided. </li>
<li>Avoid opinion or prescriptive statements (e.g. "should")</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>If any information from outside sources is required to answer the question, the author must select and cite sources according to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pJbXb5WFycFQETy2jx8L3eehlS3QfU5R">Evelyn Learning Textbook Solutions Citation Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Solutions that are sensitive and subjective should be authored using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nwsi8zCdzzJXtxXDD8-VkvVwv66YlHzLCW5M3fGaTgQ/edit">ETBS Subjective Question Guidelines</a>. </p>

<div class="line"></div>
<h4 name="Reporting_Inappropriate_Solutions">Reporting Inappropriate Solutions</h4>

<p>If a solution in a review or QC assignment addresses a topic on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mFA-EhYU56ChG5fSi5CtVcZfp0r-rethN8OdRrNgaVo/edit#gid=0">ETBS Sensitive Topics</a> list, the solution should be carefully evaluated for appropriate treatment of the topic. Solutions that are inappropriate and may cause a reader to be offended or feel uncomfortable should be reported to the Team Lead responsible for the subject. The Team Lead will evaluate the solution and provide guidance for further action.</p>
<p>The reviewer can tag the Team Lead in a comment on the IH task containing the inappropriate question</p>
<p>There are several indicators that a solution to a sensitive question is inappropriate.
<ul>
    <li>Inappropriate solutions can contain overgeneralizations, misleading statements, or false statements.</li>
    <li>Inappropriate solutions can make unscientific or unsupported claims.</li>
    <li>Inappropriate solutions can represent a specific opinion as "true".</li>
</ul>
