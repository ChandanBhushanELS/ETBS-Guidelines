<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><b>Purpose:</b> Subjective questions represent a unique learning opportunity because the number of possible answers is very large and answers vary based on the student's feelings and personal experiences. Evelyn learning solutions to subjective questions should give students the factual information required to form their own answer.</p><br>
<p><b>Objective:</b> Evelyn learning textbook solutions to subjective questions should be objective, fair, and accessible. The TQ Subjective Guidelines provide instructions for identifying, classifying, authoring, and reviewing solutions to questions that are subjective.</p><br>

<h3 name="What_is_a_Subjective_Question?">What is a Subjective Question?</h3>
<p>Subjective questions ask what the student personally feels or thinks about a topic or circumstance. The question asks respondents to give an example of a personal experience, or project into a hypothetical situation.</p>
<div class="line"></div>
<h3 name="How_Do_I_Know_if_a_Question_is_Subjective?">How Do I Know if a Question is Subjective?</h3>
<p>Subjective questions are most commonly short answer (SA) questions or essay (ES) questions. SA and ES question types ask students to provide a free response, and this format allows for open ended questions.</p>
<p>Subjective questions can be asked in a variety of ways. Some characteristics of a question can be indicative that the question is subjective. Subjective questions may have one or more of the following characteristics.
    <ul>
        <li>The question is open ended and more than one correct response is possible.</li>
        <li>The question uses "you" in the prompt, and "you" does not mean "any person." </li>
        <li>The question asks about personal feelings. </li>
        <li>The question asks for an example from the student's life. </li>
        <li>The question asks the student to take a side in an argument.</li>
        <li>The question is answerable using only personal experience or opinion.</li>
        <li>Possible answers to the question are not factually right or wrong.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<div class="line"></div>

<h3 name="Subjectivity_Rubric">Subjectivity Rubric</h3>
<p>Questions in textbooks vary in degree of subjectivity. Some subjective questions ask for personal opinions, while other subjective questions ask for opinions related to information from the textbook or specific content knowledge. Both of these types of subjective questions can be answered in multiple ways depending on the openness, or specificity, of the question and the scope of the question context. Questions with very broad scopes have many possible answers that are neither right or wrong. Questions with narrower scopes can vary in the amount of possible right or wrong answers.</p>
<p>The subjectivity rubric categorizes textbook questions into ranked levels by the degree of subjectivity.</p>
<p><b>(3)</b> Subjective</p>
<p><b>(2)</b> Subjective and Objective</p>
<p><b>(1)</b> Objective</p>

<p>All solutions for questions that score <b>(3) Subjective</b> on the Subjectivity Rubric are <b>required</b> to use these guidelines. </p>

<p>It is <b>recommended but not required</b> that solutions for questions that score <b>(2) Subjective and Objective</b> on the Subjectivity Rubric use these guidelines. </p>

<p>Solutions for questions that score <b>(1) Objective</b> on the Subjectivity Rubric <b>should not use</b> these guidelines.</p>

<p>The subjectivity rubric provides criteria and indicators for levels of subjectivity in textbook questions. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Criteria</b> provide the basis of subjectivity classification. Questions that satisfy all of the criteria for a category are ranked within that category level. </li>
<li><b>Indicators</b> are common features of questions that suggest how they might be classified. Questions in a category <b>may or may not fit one or more</b> of the indicators for that category level. </li>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Stick to the facts:</b> Students hold their own opinions and need objective information from solutions.</li>
        <li><b>Stay neutral:</b> Evelyn does not endorse a specific viewpoint in solutions.</li>
        <li><b>Avoid bias:</b> Narrative writing should be avoided.</li>
        <li><b>Be comprehensive:</b> Sensitive topics are often complicated with many sides to an argument or issue.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<div class="line"></div>
<h3 name="Acceptance_Criteria">Acceptance Criteria</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Solutions should <em>only</em> include the relevant, objective information that a student would need to formulate their <em>own</em> answer to the question.</li>
        <li>Solutions should never take a strong position, stance, or attitude on a sensitive topic</li>
        <li>Solutions should provide all the relevant factual evidence regardless of which viewpoint the evidence supports.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<div class="line"></div>

<h3 name="Types_of_Subjective_Questions">Types of Subjective Questions</h3>
<p>Subjective questions generally fit into two categories: position questions and hypothetical questions.
    <ul>
        <li>Position questions ask the student to take a side, or position, on an issue. Many position  questions are phrased such that a direct answer would begin with a "Yes" or "No" opinion.</li>
        <li>Hypothetical questions ask students to draw on their own experience or feelings to generate an answer based on a scenario</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<div class="line"></div>

<h4 name="Position_Questions">Position Questions</h4>
<p>Position questions ask students to take a position on a particular topic. The question might ask a student whether they agree/disagree with a particular statement or to support/refute different theories. Sometimes, position questions ask students their opinion of a particular idea or theory discussed in the textbook. The question may ask students to choose an option and write an argument for why they believe their chosen option is correct. Position questions can ask students to evaluate a choice that is binary (e.g. yes/no) or a scenario where more than two positions are possible. In general, students are asked to craft an argument based on their feelings.</p>
<p><b>Example Position Questions </b><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Do parents or the government have the right to decide if a child gets vaccinated?</li>
        <li>If a fertility clinic closes down who is responsible for the embryos that were stored at the clinic?</li>
        <li>Do you think humankind will ever develop a cure for AIDS? </li>
        <li>Is it ever acceptable to spank children? </li>
        <li>Do you think sexual orientation is inborn or learned? </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4 name="Hypothetical_Questions">Hypothetical Questions</h4>
<p>Hypothetical questions ask students to come up with a new idea or reflect on a past experience. The question might ask a student to think about the future or past. Sometimes, hypothetical questions ask students to imagine themselves in a scenario discussed in the textbook. In general, students are asked to use their own experience or imagination to craft an answer.</p>
<p><b>Example Hypothetical Questions</b> <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe a piece of technology you would build to stop Global Warming if there were no constraints on what you could do.</li>
        <li>Reflect on a past experience in your life when you felt peer pressure to do something you knew was immoral or illegal. </li>
        <li>Describe an experience in which you or someone you know felt discriminated against.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 name="Subjective_Solutions">Subjective Solutions</h3>
<p>In solutions to subjective questions, the answer section and explanation section of short answer (SA) and essay (ES) templates are used differently than other solutions. Direct answers for subjective/sensitive questions are not given.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Answer section in subjective solutions is used to define the context of the solution. </li>
    <li>The Explanation section in subjective solutions is used to explore the range of possible answers within that context.</li>
</ul>
<p>Solutions should only include the relevant, objective information that a student would need to form their own opinion and answer the question.</p>
<p>Formatting is an effective tool to organize solutions to subjective questions. Solutions should use bullet points or numbered lists to organize comparative factual information about the question topic. Tables are useful to display pros and cons for different positions on arguments.</p>
<p>All solutions for subjective questions should be marked "This is a sample response." in the Authoring Tool.</p> 
<p>Solutions for subjective questions should not include Hints.</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<h2 name="Solutions_for_Position_Questions">Solutions for Position Questions</h2>
<p>Position questions ask students to craft an argument. The solution to a subjective/sensitive position question identifies the types of information or factors a student needs to consider to develop their own opinion or answer. This may be the arguments for or against something or it may be the relevant theories in the textbook. The basic features of an argument are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Claim</b> (what is the position?)</li>
    <li><b>Reason</b> (why would a person support this position?)</li>
    <li><b>Rebuttal</b> (why would a person not support the position?)</li>
    <li><b>Evidence</b> (what facts underlie a person's reasons to support or not support a position?)</li>
    <li><b>Warrant</b> (what underlying assumptions link the evidence to the reasons or rebuttals?)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Answers in Position Questions</b></p>
<ul><li>The Answer section in solutions to position questions is used to identify the claims relevant to the question topic. </li></ul>
<p>Evelyn solutions should address all legitimate claims that have supporting evidence. For this reason, claims and rebuttals are effectively the same and the solution should include both. The solution should explain how the claims and rebuttals differ. Background information related to the topic can be included in the answer to provide context to the differences between the claims. The solution should include relevant claims but should not endorse any of the claims.</p>
<p><b>Explanations in Position Questions</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The Explanation section in solutions to position questions should detail the different kinds of evidence that are available related to the question topic.    </li>
    <li>The Explanation section in solutions to position questions should not attempt to explain the reasons or rebuttals that a person might feel one way or another on a topic based on the warrants they believe in.    </li>
</ul>
<p>Explanations should provide evidence and should not provide reasons, rebuttals, or warrants. The purpose of Evelyn solutions is to provide students with information they need to succeed in class. The evidence provided in the solution should align with evidence provided in the textbook. Evidence should be provided for both sides of an issue if the argument is binary. If there are more than two positions with supporting evidence, the solution should address at least three in total.</p>

<div class="line"></div>

<h4 name="Solutions_for_Hypothetical_Questions">Solutions for Hypothetical Questions</h4>
<p>Hypothetical questions have an infinite number of possible answers because student experiences vary significantly. Students are asked to select or imagine an example that suits the question. Evelyn solutions to hypothetical questions should focus on helping students understand how to evaluate their own experiences and ideas. The solution should identify two major factors in evaluating a student's experience.</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Concepts</b> (what concepts from the book are relevant to the response?)</li>
        <li><b>Variability</b> (how are the concepts used to evaluate different experiences or ideas?)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p><b>Answers in Hypothetical Questions</b><br>
<ul>
    <li>The Answer section in solutions to hypothetical questions is used to identify the concepts from the textbook addressed by the question.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Evelyn solutions should expand on the implied context of the question. The answer should identify the concepts of the question and identify main features of an experience, opinion, or idea that applies to the context. </p>
<p><b>Explanations in Hypothetical Questions</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The explanation in a solution for a hypothetical question should identify the kinds of <b>variability</b> in experiences and feelings related to the context of the question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evelyn solutions should explain to students how different experiences or feelings relate to the concepts taught in the textbook. Textbooks present scenarios and situations that can be experienced or considered from many perspectives; there is significant variance in how different people approach topics.</p>
