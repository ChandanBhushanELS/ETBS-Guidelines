</ul>

<bold>TQ Solution Sections</bold>
<p>Solutions consist of multiple sections that vary depending on the question type.</p>

<bold>Answer</bold>
<p>Correct response that satisfies the prompt. Answers are often multiple choice options, written responses, numerical values, or visual assets.</p>

<bold>Explanation</bold>
<p>Explanation of why an answer is correct. The explanation provides supporting evidence for a correct answer or shows steps needed to arrive at the answer.</p>

<bold>Wrong Explanation</bold>
<p>Explanation of why an answer is incorrect. The explanation provides factual evidence that disproves the incorrect answer choice. The explanation does not cue the correct response.</p>

<bold>Sample Response</bold>
<p>Written response to an open-ended question that may have more than one correct answer. The sample response should show the background information or steps needed to provide a complete response.</p>

<bold>Step-by-step</bold>
<p>Description of a process or calculation that includes necessary intermediate steps and provides rationales for why each step is included. Step-by-steps should always have at least two steps and a maximum of eight steps.</p>
