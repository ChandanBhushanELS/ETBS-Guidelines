<p>What makes a high-quality solution? While solutions for different question types across different disciplines will vary in terms of specific content, the intent will remain the same. A high-quality solution must always be:
<ul>
    <li>100% accurate</li>
    <li>free from grammatical errors and typos</li>
    <li>instructive in nature by providing explanations, summaries, breakdowns, links, and/or step-by-step work</li>
    <li>concise and to the point*</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>*Students have expressed that long solutions do not always equate with quality solutions. Formatting a solution as a series of steps, as a list of bullet points, or in a clear diagram is often preferred over lengthy blocks of text.</p>
