<h4>DOK Level</h4>
<p>Depth of Knowledge (DOK) is a framework for determining educational goals and objectives.
    For our purposes, it categorizes the level of thinking required to answer a question.
    The scale runs from 1 to 4 as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Recall/Reproduction</b> - Requires a student to simply state or understand a fact or concept. This may include providing a definition, example, or summary.
                        It can also include explaining a concept or how concepts relate, solving examples, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Skills/Concepts</b> - Requires a student to apply their knowledge of a concept to a specific situation.</li>
    <li><b>Strategic Thinking</b> - Requires a student to break down underlying concepts and understand the organization of ideas or relationships between ideas.
        It can also require a student to evaluate an example or implementation of a concept.</li>
    <li><b>Extended Thinking</b> - Requires a student to create a new, novel work.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Difficulty</h4>
<p>Difficulty represents relatively how easy or hard a student taking the relevant course would find the question.
All titles/chapters should have a range of difficulties. Keep in mind that this is a relative measure within the book, not absolute.</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Easy</b> - Answering the question should be trivial if the student has read the material.</li>
    <li><b>Medium</b> - Answering the question requires a reasonable amount of effort and success would represent an appropriate level of knowledge.</li>
    <li><b>Hard</b> - Most students would be expected to struggle to answer the question, or require multiple attempts. Success would demonstrate mastery of the concept.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Concepts</h4>
<p>Concepts represent the subject or idea that a question is about. Said another way, this field should hold the main concepts
a student would need to understand in order to answer the question. Choose 1â€“6 relevant concepts for each question and enter them in the field ordered by relevance (e.g., the most relevant/applicable concept should appear first in the list).</p>
<p>If you need to include a concept that isn't in a list, flag the question and let us know.</p>

<p>Hierarchies</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/hierarchies/bio_final.txt">Biology</a></li>
    <li><a href="/hierarchies/anatomy_final.txt">Anatomy and Physiology</a></li>
    <li><a href="/hierarchies/calculus_final.txt">Calculus</a></li>
    <li><a href="/hierarchies/stats_final.txt">Statistics</a></li>
    <li><a href="/hierarchies/fina_final.txt">Accounting</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some notes: </p>
<ul>
    <li>If you find that a large number of child concepts are relevant to the question, consider just tagging the question to the parent concept.</li>
    <li>If you tag a solution to a child concept, there is no need to also tag it to the parent concept unless it is also highly relevant.</li>
    <li>In general, there is no need to include concepts that are the same as the chapter or section title for the solution. These will be included automatically.</li>
</ul>
